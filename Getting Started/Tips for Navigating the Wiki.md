# Tips for Navigating the Wiki

The Profisee Platform Help wiki contains all information necessary for Administration and Web Stewardship for the Profisee Platform. However, the information is contained across hundreds of articles under dozens of sections of documentation, which may feel difficult to effectively comb through. To navigate the wiki with ease, note the following tips to quickly locate specific information.

- On the left-hand side of the wiki, a navigation bar containing the topics and subtopics for each section of the Help documentation can be expanded to locate specific articles within that section.

- You can pinpoint specific articles by searching for keywords in the *Search...* bar above the topic headers.
- If you enter a search phrase without enclosing it in quotes, you will see results that contain the phrase OR any word in the phrase.
- If you enter a search phrase and enclose it in quotes, you will see results for *only the specific phrase* and not also the results for any of the individual words in the phrase.
- After performing a search, an **X** appears to the right of the search term(s). After selecting the article you want to view, you can click the **X** to show the chapter/section in the topic tree where the result is located. Using the navigation will help you to read all the topics in that chapter/section to gain more insight. ![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-ie1f5d3356852e557.png)
- Above the search bar is the Version Select, which lets you view information for different versions of the product.
