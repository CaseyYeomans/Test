# Update a Server License

To update a Profisee cluster license:

1. On the primary server (the first Profisee server installed in the cluster), navigate to `Programs > Profisee Server > Profisee Server Configuration Manager`.
2. Click **Edit an existing instance**.
3. Wait a moment for Profisee to retrieve licensing information from the database, and then click **Edit this instance**.
4. Click **Add or Replace License**.
5. Navigate to the new license file (`*.plic`), and then select it.
6. Click **Open**, and then click **OK**.

A pop up message notifies you that the license was applied successfully.
7. Click **OK**, and then click **Next** to continue.
8. When the configuration on the Progress and Finish dialog indicates that the configuration is complete, click **Finish**.

You must cycle through all of the installation screens, even if you are only changing the license. If you are not making any additional changes, the Progress and Finish step completes quickly.

9. Click **Exit**.
