# Profisee SDK Accelerator Framework Documentation

When using the SDK for custom development, there may be times where you need a resource to help explain what method to use or which parameter to set. The Accelerator Framework Documentation is a Compiled HTML Help file (.chm) that contains much of this information. The Documentation is provided as part of the SDK software installation.

## Accessing the Accelerator Framework Documentation

1. Open the Profisee SDK installation location.

By default, it is located here:

*%programFiles%\Profisee SDK\SDKVersion*
