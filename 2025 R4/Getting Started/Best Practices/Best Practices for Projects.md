# Best Practices for Projects

This guide outlines the essential steps and best practices for a successful Profisee Master Data Management (MDM) implementation (project), highlighting both critical and supporting activities, timelines, and how AI can help.

MDM stakeholders can use it to answer the key questions that arise during project planning and execution. It covers the various activities required to accomplish business objectives, providing insight into best practices for ensuring implementation success. The guidance provided here is intentionally generic. The specific details and recommendations for your implementation will depend on the scope of your project, your organization's use case, unique business requirements, data volumes, and the technical landscape into which Profisee is being deployed.

The tables below summarize the work effort, timeline, and AI force multipliers for the major activities required for solution development.

### MDM Projects & Time to Value

A project is the work required to achieve an objective within a finite timeframe. We broadly categorize MDM use cases as analytical, where the data is primarily used for decision-making, or operational, which requires additional work to integrate MDM data and processes into your business operations. Analytical projects typically involve fewer stakeholders and less change management. Operational use cases typically take longer to implement than analytical ones. Profisee has worked with hundreds of customers and can share real-world project timelines and budgets that we have seen. Time to value refers to the period it takes from the start of a project until the organization begins to realize measurable benefits or outcomes from that project. The scope, timeline and budget of your MDM project will be based on your own objectives and the approach used.

- **Profisee Fast Start:** Customers that engage Profisee's professional services team commonly implement their initial projects in 3 to 4 months with approximately 12 to 16 weeks' effort. Project budgets start at approximately 1x of the initial software cost. Profisee's Fast Start schedule is shown below.
