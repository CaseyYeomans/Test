# Working with Contribution Tasks

Contribution Tasks allow assignees to change values of a record and advance the workflow to the next task in the workflow if one exists. A Contribution Task is used to add or change data of the member associated with the task. When a contribution task is assigned to you, you have three options to choose from after changing the data.

These options are:

- **Save**: Save any changes made to the member without completing the task. The task remains open for further changes by you or another assignee.
- **Save and Continue**: Save changes and complete the task. You have officially completed your contribution to the task, and the task allows the workflow to continue further processing.
- **Cancel**: Close the form without making any data changes. The task remains open and is not removed from your task list.

To open a task, navigate to your Task List within the FastApp Portal and click the task. This opens the associated form, allowing you to add or change data.
