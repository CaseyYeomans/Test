# Configure FastApp Portal Themes

Your FastApp portal styling and theme can be configured to better represent your organization. These configuration options allow you to change the colors of page elements and text and add custom logos to replace the default Profisee logo.

In future releases, theming will be available through Profisee Portal directly. As of version 2021.R3 through current versions, you must change your theme preferences through the [Profisee REST API](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/updating_portal_themes_using_the_rest_api).
