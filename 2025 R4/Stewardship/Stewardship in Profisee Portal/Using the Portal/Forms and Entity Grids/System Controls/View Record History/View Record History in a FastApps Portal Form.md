# View Record History in a FastApps Portal Form

You can review data change details of a record, including a history of what was changed, when, and by whom, by viewing the History panel. Data history creates and maintains a historical record of data in log form. You can review your data over time to track trends and build projections to support future efforts.

To view data change history in the Profisee web portal:

1. Click a record you want to review to enter the **View/Edit** view.
2. Navigate to the **View record history** tab.

View History details in the history window. Click an entry to expand the details panel and view a list of attributes associated with the record. Changes appear in this list.

If an attribute value is over 50 characters long, it will be truncated in the main history view. You can see the full details of the prior or new attribute values by clicking on the attribute value. This displays the full value in a non-modal dialog. You can open both the prior and new values if you need to compare them side by side.
