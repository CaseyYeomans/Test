# Using the Report Viewer

Profisee uses Power BI to create real-time data reports in Profisee FastApp portal. A page that has been configured with an embedded Power BI report displays the data report in a zone on that page. Clicking the arrow icon in the bottom-right corner of the zone opens the full Power BI report in the Power BI portal in a new window. A user can also click the Fullscreen icon to view the embedded report in fullscreen mode, zoom in or zoom out with the zoom slider, or click the Share or Media icons to embed the report into a linked social media account.

The information displayed in the report is determined by the configuration of the Power BI report itself. For more information on using Power BI reports, refer to the Microsoft [Power BI documentation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/)

If your version of Profisee is still using legacy reports (ones Powered by Izenda prior to version 2023.R1), you will receive an error message in a report zone. A system administrator must update the Profisee instance to use Power BI reports to view reports in FastApp Portal.
