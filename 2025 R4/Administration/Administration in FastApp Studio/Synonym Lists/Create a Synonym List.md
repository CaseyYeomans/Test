# Create a Synonym List

Create synonym lists to define synonyms to replace commonly occurring words during the matching process and improve matching results. After a synonym list is created, it can be used with a matching strategy.

1. Select **Administration** in the navigation panel.
2. Select the **Synonym Lists** administration task.
3. Click **New**.
4. Enter a name for the synonym list in the **Name** field.
5. Enter the synonym value in the **Find (Synonym)** column. This identifies the source string to replace.
6. Enter the replacement value in the **Replace With (term)** column. This identifies the standard term to use in place of the synonym.
7. To search within a value for substrings, select **Search in String**. For all synonyms where this option is cleared, only whole words will be replaced.

Remove a value from the matching process by leaving the **Replace With (Term)** column blank.
