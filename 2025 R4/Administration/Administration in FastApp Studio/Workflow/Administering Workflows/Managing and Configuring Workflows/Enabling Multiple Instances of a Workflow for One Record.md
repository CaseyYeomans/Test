# Enabling Multiple Instances of a Workflow for One Record

A workflow administrator can configure a workflow to allow multiple instances of the workflow on a single record code. By default, the system allows only one instance of a workflow to run for any given record to prevent instances from conflicting with each other. If an administrator wants to change this behavior, this setting can be disabled from the Workflow administration tab in Profisee FastApp Studio.

1. Navigate to the Workflow administration tab in Profisee FastApp Studio.
2. Select the workflow you want to edit.
3. Click the **Edit** button on the topmost toolbar. Alternatively, right click the desired workflow and select **Edit Workflow Properties**.
4. Click the checkbox to allow multiple instances of the workflow to run concurrently on the same record code.
