# Delete an Attribute

You can delete an attribute from an entity when it is no longer needed. To delete an entity:

1. Right-click in the column header of the attribute you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete Attribute**.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.

The Data Deletion Acknowledgment window opens.
4. Type your name to confirm the deletion and then click **OK**.

The attribute is removed from the entity.

When an attribute is referenced by a business rule, you cannot delete the attribute unless you remove the business rule.
