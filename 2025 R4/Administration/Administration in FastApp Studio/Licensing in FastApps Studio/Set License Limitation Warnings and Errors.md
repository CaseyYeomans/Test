# Set License Limitation Warnings and Errors

License limit information appears in several forms across the Profisee Platform, keeping you aware of your capacity and usage. You can set the threshold for warning messages, tailoring the frequency according to your own use case.

## Set the Record Limit Warning Threshold in System Settings

In System Settings, pick an appropriate threshold value. The number represents the percentage of capacity that must be used to launch an error message. In the example below, when 30% of the available records capacity is used, warning messages will display. This number is probably significantly lower than practical, and is used only for this example.

1. Navigate to **System Settings | Data Management**.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the numerical text field.
