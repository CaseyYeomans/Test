# Advanced Modeling Overview

Open the **Advanced Modeling** tab under Administration to import, export, edit, save, deploy, and create new metadata definitions.

With Advanced Modeling, you can:

- Edit the system model for the current instance
- Import and edit model files
- Export the model definition
- Publish metadata changes to Profisee Platform

## Tasks

The following are the main, common tasks in Advanced Modeling.

- [Open a model from a file](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/open_a_model_from_a_file)
- [Check out the model from the server](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/check_out_the_model_from_the_server)
- [Import from SQL Server](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/import_from_sql_server)
- [Save a model as a file](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/save_a_model_as_a_file)
- [Save the system model to a different server](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/save_the_system_model_to_a_different_server)

While changes to the local model definition affect metadata only, changing the metadata of a server model populated with data can have severe consequences. For example, if you open the model and delete an attribute, and then save that model back to the server, the data contained in that attribute will be lost.
