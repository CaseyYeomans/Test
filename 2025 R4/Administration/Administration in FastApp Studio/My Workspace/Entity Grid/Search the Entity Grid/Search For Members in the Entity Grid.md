# Search For Members in the Entity Grid

The entity grid search box makes it possible to search entity member attributes for text strings.

To search for members:

1. With an entity open in a workspace tab, click inside the search box at the top of the tab, displayed at the right of the current context.
2. Type the string to use in your search.

You can search in two ways:

- **Search for the string values anywhere within the selected attribute values**

Type the string without punctuation

Example: Searching for **Bob Robert** matches **Bob Roberts**, **Bobby Robertson**, **Robert Bobbett**, and **Robert Bobowski**
- **Find a match for the string in order, with spaces**

Enclose the search term in double quotation marks

Example: Searching for **"Bob Robert"** matches the members with the following values: **Bob Roberts**, **Joebob Robertson**, and **Bob Robertson**
3. Select the attributes to use in your search.
1. Open the **Search** list by clicking the arrow next to the Search icon.
2. Select each attribute you want to include in the search so that it appears in the list with a check mark.
4. Click **Search**.

The members matching your search criteria display in the entity grid.

Only text and link attributes are included in the search. Only attributes of these types appear in the list.

The Name and Code attributes are included by default. To exclude these from your search, click the attribute to remove the check mark.

Search checks all included attributes in all members in the entity for the matching string, whether they are included in the current page or not.

Searches apply to all attribute group tabs in a view tab.

Hovering over the Filter icon displays the search information currently applied to the entity grid.
