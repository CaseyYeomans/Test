# Change the Number of Paged Records

Control the number of records visible in the grid using the Page Size menu. Display up to 1000 records per page when changing many records at once. Display as few as 50 records per page for faster performance (recommended).

To change the number of paged records:

1. Open an Entity view tab.
2. Locate the Page Size list below the entity grid. Click the list to open it.
3. Select the new page size by clicking on a page size option in the **Page Size** list. The page size controls the number of members that appear on one page in the grid.

The entity grid updates to display the selected number of records.

Always use the smallest page size possible as a standard to improve overall system performance for all users. Increase the page size temporarily when needed.

Use the scroll bar on the right side of the entity grid for navigating through members within a single page. The number of records that you can view at once depends on your monitor and your display settings.

The page size you select determines your Current View setting. This setting affects options such as filtering, sorting, and viewing in Excel. Page size options are also available on the Page Size tab in the **Filter and Sort** dialog.
