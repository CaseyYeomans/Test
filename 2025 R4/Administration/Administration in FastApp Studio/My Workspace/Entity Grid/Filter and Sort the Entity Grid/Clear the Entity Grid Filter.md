# Clear the Entity Grid Filter

To clear the filter currently applied to the entity grid:

1. Click **Filter**.

The Filter and Sort dialog opens.
2. Click **Delete all**.

All filter statements are removed.
3. Click **Save**.

Remember to click **Save** after you click **Delete all**. Closing the dialog without saving is the same action as clicking **Cancel**, and the previous filter will be reapplied to the grid.
