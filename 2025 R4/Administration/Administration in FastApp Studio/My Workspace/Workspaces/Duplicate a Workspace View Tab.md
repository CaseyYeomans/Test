# Duplicate a Workspace View Tab

You can open a second copy of any type of workspace tab, which can be useful if you want to compare an entity before and after filtering.

1. Right-click the tab in your workspace that you want to duplicate.
2. Click **Duplicate** on the menu.

A second copy of the tab opens in your workspace.

You can only duplicate the workspace view tabs. You cannot duplicate administration tabs.
