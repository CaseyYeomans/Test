# Navigate the Profisee Interface

Main Toolbar

The main toolbar appears at the top of the interface. The main toolbar is always present, and provides access to general functions like saving and opening workspaces and accessing settings.

For more information on the main toolbar options, see [Profisee Toolbars](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/profisee_toolbars).

## Navigation Panel

The navigation panel lets you navigate between tabs within a workspace as well as between the workspace tabs and the administrative tabs (for administrators). The top section of the navigation panel defaults to the name "My Workspace." Use this section to navigate between any open tabs. When you open a saved workspace, or save your current workspace with a file name, "My Workspace" changes to the new workspace name.

For administrators the bottom section of the navigation panel provides direct links to available administrative tabs. Clicking these links will open a tab if not already open or navigate to the tab when already open. You can switch between your workspace tabs and the administration tabs by clicking the links in the navigation panel. You can open both workspace and administration tabs at the same time and switch between the two tab groups.

## Entity Grid Toolbar

The entity grid toolbar displays when you open an Entity view tab. The toolbar contains the basic tools that let you add, edit, delete, and generally work with data in the entity grid.

## Search and Filter Options

To the left of the entity grid toolbar, next to the name of the currently displayed entity, are the Search and Filter options. Use these options to locate members in the entity grid, or to filter members based on particular attribute values.
