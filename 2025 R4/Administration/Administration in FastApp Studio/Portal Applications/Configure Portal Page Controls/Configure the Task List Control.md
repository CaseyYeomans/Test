# Configure the Task List Control

The Task List control displays a list of task assignments for the current user in a portal application page. The user can click a task in the list to view the information and complete the task.

To configure the Task List control:

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a portal application page](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/add_a_new_portal_application_page), adding a Task List control.
2. In the Name field, enter a name for the control.

The Name field is for administrative reference only and does not display to users when the control is viewed in the portal.

There are no further configurable options for the Task List control.

It is recommended that you include only one task list control per portal application page.
