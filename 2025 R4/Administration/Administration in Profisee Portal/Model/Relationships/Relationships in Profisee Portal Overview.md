# Relationships in Profisee Portal Overview

Profisee Admins can model **Relationships** in the Administration section of the Profisee Portal without needing to use the Profisee FastApp Studio interface. Using the **Relationship** tab under the **Model** section allows you to create and edit Relationships to define how entities and records relate to one another. ![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i43547acd8e8a44dd.png)

- **Type**: The type of relationship (One to Many, Many to Many, or Recursive)
- **Entity A**: The first entity selected for this relationship
- **Predicate (A)**: How Entity A relates to Entity B (is parent of, is related to, etc.)
- **Entity B**: The second entity selected for this relationship
- **Predicate (B)**: How Entity B relates to Entity A (is parent of, is related to, etc.)
- **Created By**: The user who established this relationship
- **Created On**: The datetime this relationship was established
- **Updated By**: The user who last updated the relationship

You can select one or more (if deleting or exporting) relationships in the list, then right-click them to **open**, **delete**, or **export** the selected relationship(s).![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i23ab7fc5367858a.png)
