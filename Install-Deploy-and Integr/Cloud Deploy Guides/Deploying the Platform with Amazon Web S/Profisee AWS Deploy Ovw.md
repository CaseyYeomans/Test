# Profisee AWS Deployment Overview

The Profisee Platform can be deployed across a variety of cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This topic covers the broad planning and information gathering that should precede a deployment on AWS. The goal of this guide is to ensure that the deployment and DevOps team have all the information they need in advance of the actual deployment process. Assuming you have thoroughly planned your deployment and you have completed all prerequisite steps, executing the deployment can be accomplished in less than 2 hours.

The most successful journeys begin with a good plan. The goal of this topic and its related subtopics are to guide you through the various deployment considerations and scenarios and to ensure that you set up all required prerequisites and capture all the needed information required to specify the details in the accompanying deployment templates (**cluster.yaml** and **Settings.yaml**). Each of the outer planning steps provides the specified information you will need when specifying the template properties in the .yaml files listed above. The .yaml templates are available for download in Profisee's [AWS EKS GitHub Site](https://github.com/Profisee/kubernetes/tree/master/AWS-EKS-CLI).

The figure above illustrates the planning and preparation process the deployment team should conduct in advance of the actual cluster deployment execution. The goal is to establish the prerequisites necessary to complete the cluster deployment. We recommend you maintain a simple text document that captures all the details outlined above and then have this document handy when moving on to the actual deployment process.

The planning process involves 6 critical planning steps that help identify details of your organization's specific deployment scenario and affect several prerequisite setups that will ensure that your deployment runs successfully. These planning areas are described below:

1. [Preparing Your AWS Environment](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/preparing_your_aws_environment) involves establishing the prerequisites and to perform the cluster deployment. Consult the Required AWS Deployment Permissions topic to ensure that members of the deployment team have the necessary rights to perform the prerequisite configuration outlined in the planning steps below.
2. [Planning Your Database Configuration](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/planning_your_database_configuration) involves determining if you plan to create a new SQL Server instance related to your cluster or whether you want to use an existing SQL Server instance.
3. [Planning Your File Storage Configuration](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/planning_your_file_storage_configuration_aws) involves determining if you plan to create a new EBS storage volume or whether you want to use an existing storage volume for the Profisee instance's file storage needs.
4. [Planning Your Security Strategy](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/planning_your_security_strategy) involves establishing your authorization provider(s) and the method for obtaining your certificates used for secure communications.
5. [Planning Your Cluster & Network Configuration](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/planning_your_cluster_and_network_configuration) involves identifying your cluster name along with its scaling and network requirements.
6. [Obtaining Your Profisee License & Azure Container Registry (ACR) Credentials](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/obtaining_your_profisee_license_azure_container_registry_credentials) establishes the information you need to supply to Profisee Support to obtain the licenses necessary for this cluster.

Once you are ready to deploy, you can complete the **cluster.yaml** and **settings.yaml** templates used for the physical deployment of the EKS cluster in which the Profisee Platform runs. Refer to the instructions outlined on the [Deploy Profisee platform on to AWS Elastic Kubernetes services (EKS)](https://github.com/Profisee/kubernetes/tree/master/AWS-EKS-CLI) site for step-by-step details of this process.
