# Troubleshooting ARM Deployment Errors and Failures

During the deployment process, you may encounter one of several common errors that prevent your instance of Profisee from deploying. While the instance is being deployed, you can check its status within the deployment process page by clicking **Deployment in progress...** from your notifications icon. On this page, various deployment steps are listed with a status and an indicator. All deployment errors are listed on this page. ![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i3a2d0873fff90a54.png)

Common errors and the steps needed to resolve them are included below. If your error is not listed, or the solution does not resolve the issue, contact support at [support.profisee.com](https://support.profisee.com/aspx/CustomerHome).

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Error** | **Description** | **Solution** |
| **InstallProfiseePlatform** is **InternalServiceError** | An Azure-related error occurred during the deployment process. | Redeploy using the same information for the ARM template properties. If this does not resolve the issue, your Managed Identity may not be properly configured or specified. To avoid re-entering the ARM template properties, see [Reconfiguring the Instance without Re-executing the ARM Template](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/restart_the_instance_configuration_process_without_re-executing_the_arm_template) |
| **Version [version number] is not supported in this region.** | The selected **Kubernetes Version** is not compatible with the selected **Region**. | Select a Kubernetes version two releases earlier than the latest, then redeploy. Repeat with earlier versions until one succeeds. You can use the command az aks get-versions to view supported versions in your region. Leaving the **Kubernetes Version** property blank will cause the deployment to use the default, recommended version of Kubernetes. |
| **[Cluster Name]/nplinux1**is **Failed** | The operation was overridden and canceled by a later operation.This occurs if you have deleted your old Resource Group or Cluster and are attempting to re-deploy using a Resource Group or Cluster with the same name before Azure finishes deleting the previous Resource Group or Cluster. | Wait for Azure to finish deleting the resources, or use a different Resource Group and Cluster name. |
| **Profisee nodes failed to start because they cannot access the database server.** | A communication error between the nodes failed because of a firewall configuration issue. If you have opted to use an existing SQL Server instance with your Profisee cluster, you must configure and open your firewall within a specific timeframe during the deployment process. For more information, see [Configuring the Firewall on SQL Server for Your Profisee Cluster](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_the_firewall_on_sql_server_for_your_profisee_cluster) | Redeploy the Profisee instance and open your firewall during the designated timeframe. To avoid re-entering the ARM template properties, see [Reconfiguring the Instance without Re-executing the ARM Template](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/restart_the_instance_configuration_process_without_re-executing_the_arm_template) |
| **Deployment fails with the resource "PreReqCheck"** | An initial deployment check determined that one or more prerequisites of the deployment have not been met. | Refer to the [AKS Deployment Guide](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/deploying_profisee_using_the_arm_template) and ensure all prerequisites are satisfied. |
