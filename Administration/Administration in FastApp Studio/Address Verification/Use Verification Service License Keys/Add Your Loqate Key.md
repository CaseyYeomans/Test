# Add Your Loqate Key

A Loqate license makes it possible to perform Mailing address verification for international addresses.

For more information on obtaining a Loqate key, see [Obtaining a Loqate key](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/obtaining_a_loqate_key).

To add your license key:

1. Click **Settings** in the main toolbar.
2. Click **System Settings**.
3. Navigate to **Address Verification** > **Service Provider Keys**.
4. Copy (CTRL+C) your Loqate license key to the clipboard.
5. Locate the **Loqate API key** row and then paste (CTRL+V) the key in the **Value** column.
6. Click **Save** or **Save and Close**.
7. Reconnect to the Profisee Server.

The administrator and all attached users should reconnect after a new key is added. Adding and updating keys affects licensing information. Reconnecting allows to apply the new license settings.

## Update an Expired Verification Service License

If you originally licensed Melissa Data or Loqate as a part of Address Verification, you can add your new address verification service keys in System Settings without obtaining a new Profisee Platform license.

Melissa Data and Loqate keys added through System Settings will override any verification service licensing in your license.

To view your license settings, click **Help > About** in the main toolbar. If you have licensed Melissa Data or Loqate separately (and have applied your keys in System Settings), then the Verification Services period expiration date will list the service with an expiration date of "Not Applicable."

If your agreement with the verification service expires and you do not obtain new keys, then this section will indicate that the Verification Services period expiration date is expired. You will not have access to the verification service until you obtain a new service key.
