# Import a Workflow

Profisee Workflow includes the option to export workflow configurations and then import them into the same server or other servers. This process provides a way to back up workflows and to transport them between different servers.

## Import a Workflow Configuration File

To import a workflow:

1. Navigate to **Administration | Workflow**.
2. In the Workflow toolbar, click **Import/Export**.
3. On the menu, select **Import**and choose to import Definition, Configuration, or Definition and Configuration.

- **Definition**: The logic of the workflow as created in Visual Studio
- **Configuration**: The settings of the workflow as defined in Profisee FastApp Studio

1. Browse to the file location where the files are saved.
2. Select workflow file to import.
3. Click **Open**.

The workflow is added to the list. Note that only one workflow file can be imported at a time. To import multiple workflows, you must first export multiple workflows as one workflow file.
