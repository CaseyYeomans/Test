# Configuring and Assigning Workflow Activities Overview

Once a workflow has been registered, the administrator can configure six types of activities on the Details tab of the Workflow Configuration dialog:

- [Contribution Task](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_contribution_and_approval_tasks)
- [Approval Task](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_contribution_and_approval_tasks)
- [Send Notification](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_send_notification_activities)
- [Match Member](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_match_member_activities)
- [New Member Data Context](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_new_member_data_context_activities)
- [Verify Member Address](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_verify_member_address_activities)

As part of the configuration process, the administrator may assign activities to users. Activities that can be assigned to users are referred to as Task Activities. Other workflow activities perform background functions of the workflow and are not assigned to users. When a task is assigned to a user, they are notified to complete that task, typically within a specified timeframe. Users can be assigned individually or as part of a team.The [Contribution Task](http://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_contribution_and_approval_tasks), [Approval Task](http://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_contribution_and_approval_tasks), and [Send Notification](http://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_send_notification_activities) activities are all Task Activities and can be assigned to users and teams.
