# Add a New Portal Application Page

1. In the navigation panel, under Administration, click **FastApps**.
2. Access the Pages tab, either by [editing an existing application](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/edit_a_portal_application) or [adding a new one](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_new_fastapp).
3. On the Pages tab, click **New** in the toolbar.

The Portal Page Configuration dialog appears.
4. From the **Layout** section, select the zone configuration to use for the controls that will display in the page.

Select a layout with at least the same number of portal controls you want to add. If you want to add two controls, choose a layout with two or more zones.

5. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the page.

The page name displays in the list of internal pages when you create a new menu item.

6. In the **Description** field, enter text describing the purpose of the page (optional)
7. Inside a zone, click **Add**.

The list of available controls appears.

You can also click Save to save the page without any controls.

9. From the list, select the control to add to the zone.
10. Complete the information in the Properties area.

The configuration process varies depending on the selected control. For more information, see [Configuring FastApps Portal Page Controls](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_fastapps_portal_page_controls).
11. Click **Save**.

The page is added to the list of pages. You can now add a menu item on the Menu tab to link this new page to the portal application menu.

Be sure to link the new portal application page to a menu item in the portal. If you do not link the page to a menu item, you will not be able to access it in the portal.

Once you create a portal application page, you can clone the page and all of its contents by selecting the page and clicking **Copy** in the toolbar. The cloned page will be named "[Page Name] Copy" by default.
