# Edit a Subscriber Configuration

To edit a subscriber configuration:

1. In the navigation panel, click **Real-Time Event Processing**, under Administration.
2. On the Real-Time Event Processing tab, click **Subscriber configurations**.

The Subscriber Configurations tab displays.
3. Select the subscriber configuration in the list that you want to edit.
4. On the toolbar, click **Edit**.

The configuration tab opens the subscriber configuration.
5. Make the necessary changes to the subscriber configuration.
6. Click **Save and close** to exit the subscriber configuration tab.

After a subscriber configuration is added to an event scenario, only limited options, such as the data transfer strategy or transfer action, can be edited.

If an event processing task is running while you are editing the subscriber configuration, stop and restart event processing after editing a subscriber configuration. This forces the event processing cache to update and to begin using the new settings.
