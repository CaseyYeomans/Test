# Preview a Form

After you have added layout elements to a form, you can preview by clicking **Preview Form**.

No data displays in the form in the preview window. You can view tabs, buttons, columns, and other layout objects included in the Layout section of the form editing panel.

Some controls will not render correctly in the preview window.
