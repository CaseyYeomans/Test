# Forms Overview

Forms are an administrative feature designed to build and configure HTML templates. The Forms feature provides great flexibility for designing forms, making it possible for administrators to create custom forms allowing workflow participants to interact with master data through FastApps Portal and workflows in countless ways. The Forms feature includes a library of controls and button script actions for creating forms to support numerous workflow scenarios.

Forms are an integral component in workflows. When a workflow is configured in Workflow Administrator, each activity must include a form to display information to participants and provide a means for responding to or contributing information. These forms display as HTML Web pages in the portal when users view their tasks. The displayed controls and the behavior of buttons in these Web pages depend on the form configuration.

Another use for forms is to display in a Portal entity grid. The entity grid control, when added to portal application pages, can be configured to use forms so users can add members and open members.

Before configuring forms for a workflow, first develop and publish the workflow using the Developer version of the SDK. Workflows are constructed using Visual Studio. Refer to the SDK documentation and training materials for more information on developing workflows.
