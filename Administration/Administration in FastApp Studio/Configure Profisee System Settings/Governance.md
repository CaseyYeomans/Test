# Governance

The table below displays options and functions for Governance in System Settings.

| Option | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Automatically Certify Data Assets | Automatically applies the**Certified** designation to **Certifiable Profisee Assets**. |
| Minimum Log Level | Determines the minimum error log level. If set to **Verbose**, the system will log messages of all severity. If its logging level is set to **Fatal**, it will only log critical errors. |

A **Certifiable Profisee Asset** is a data set that can include Entities, Hierarchies, and Golden Record Data Sets (GRDS) which can be automatically flagged as a certified asset.

Other assets, such as Instances, Attributes, Relationships, and Matching Strategies, can be *manually* certified, but cannot be automatically certified as a Certifiable Profisee Asset.
