# Reordering Attributes

Advanced Modeling lets you change the order of appearance of attributes when viewed in entities.

Re-order attributes within an entity:

1. In the model tree, expand the model to the **Entities** container.
2. Expand the entity containing the attribute to be repositioned
3. Expand **Attributes**.
4. Drag the attributes within the tree to reorder them.

The attribute moves to the position before the attribute you drag it to. You can also refer to the grid to check the display order (using the Order column).
5. Save or publish your model.

The attributes appear in this order the next time you open the model.

Any attributes that you move to new positions appear as shaded rows in the modeling grid.

Changing the position of an attribute appears as a change to the model when you publish (attribute order is ignored when opened from a file and published as a merge).

Name and Code are always the first two attributes and cannot be moved to new positions.
