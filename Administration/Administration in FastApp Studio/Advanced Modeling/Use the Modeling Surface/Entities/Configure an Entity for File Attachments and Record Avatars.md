To enable Record Avatars, you must add a **Record Avatar**file attachment category with the allowed file extensions .jpg, .bmp, and .png.
4. Double-click the blank **File attachm****ent type or category** field to name it. This is the category name that is displayed to users on the web portal.
5. Double-click the blank **Allowed file extensions** field and type the file extensions you want to allow for that category. If you want to allow all file extensions, type **.\*** into the field.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 as needed, then click **Save** when finished.
7. Click **Publish To Server** to launch your changes. If the portal is already open on your machine, you will need to click **Refresh Portal** under the **?** icon to view your changes.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/StaticAsset/Read/file-idbaf32c1a247befd.png)![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/StaticAsset/Read/file-i82a6eb3de21853cb.png)

To remove a file attachment category, navigate to the configuration window and select the entire row by clicking the box to the left of the category name, then click the **Delete** icon. Deleting a file attachment category will delete all file attachments associated with it.
