# Delete Entities

Delete an entity in using Advanced Modeling:

1. Expand the model to the **Entities** container.
2. Do one of the following:

1. Expand **Entities**.
2. In the model tree, right-click the entity you want to delete.
3. Click **Delete** on the menu

**--or--**

4. In the model tree, select **Entities**.
5. In the modeling grid, select the entity you want to delete.
6. Click **Delete** on the modeling grid toolbar.

The entity is removed from the model.

If the entity you want to delete is referenced by a domain-based attribute, you must first remove the reference to the entity before Advanced Modeling will allow you to delete it.
