# Close a Model

Close a model to remove it from the modeling surface.

To close a model:

1. Right-click the model you want to close.
2. Click **Close** on the menu.

If you have not saved a model to file, or if there are unsaved changes in a model file, you are prompted to save the changes before closing the model.

The model is removed from the modeling surface. If it is the last model open in the modeling surface, the Advanced Modeling tab menu displays.

You cannot delete the model. If you want to remove the model from the modeling surface, use the **Close** function. If you want to remove the system model, you can overwrite it with an empty model.
