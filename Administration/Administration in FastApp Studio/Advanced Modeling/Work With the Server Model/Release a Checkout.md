# Release a Checkout

When you check out the system model, the checkout is released when you select to check it in after publishing the model. You may need to release a checkout at other times, such as when you have published the model to a different server, saved it to a file, or simply want to work with the model locally without publishing it.

To release a checkout for a model on a server:

1. On the Advanced Modeling tab, click the **Open** menu.
2. Right-click the top level of the model in the tree view pane, and then click **Release checkout** on the menu.

If the user does not currently have the model checked out, the "Release checkout" option is unavailable. This option is only available for models opened from the server.

When the system model is checked out, it cannot be edited in any Profisee Platform feature areas. This includes attributes, entities, and all options relating to Adaptive Modeling. The checkout puts a lock on the model to prevent conflicting changes.

You can release checkouts for other users. You can also release a checkout by right-clicking the model in the modeling surface and clicking **Release Checkout** on the menu.
