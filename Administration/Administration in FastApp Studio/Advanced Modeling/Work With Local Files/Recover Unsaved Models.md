# Recover Unsaved Models

If you are working with a model, Advanced Modeling attempts to recover the active model if the the application unexpectedly closes. Files are periodically saved to a temporary directory. When you reopen the Advanced Modeling tab, you are prompted to recover any models that were open when the application closed.

To recover an unsaved model, respond **Yes** when you are prompted to do so.
