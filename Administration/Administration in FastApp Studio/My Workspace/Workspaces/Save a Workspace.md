# Save a Workspace

Workspace files let you keep the settings in your Desktop workspace between Profisee sessions. Tab layout, color and font selections, open entities, grid filters, and other display options are saved when you save your workspace to a file. All opened workspace tabs are saved in the workspace file.

To save a workspace to a file:

1. Click Save the workspace on the main toolbar.
2. If you are creating a new workspace, specify a name and location for the workspace file.
3. Click **Save** to create the workspace file.

If a single workspace meets your needs, you can use the **Always save workspace on exit and load on startup** option. This option automatically saves the current tab layout when you exit Profisee. The same tabs with the same options open automatically the next time you start Profisee.
