# Paste Append

Paste Append lets you add records or update existing records by letting you paste data from Excel directly into an entity. When data is inserted using Paste Append, data on the clipboard is added as a new row in the current active page in the entity grid.

1. Copy the member you want to create or update or the data you want to add to the entity grid.
2. Right-click inside the entity grid where you want to add the data as a new member.
3. Do one of the following:

If the source attribute columns are in the same order as the destination attributes in Profisee, click **Paste Append** on the menu.

**--or--**

If the source attribute columns are not in the same order as the destination attributes in Profisee, click **Paste Append With Headers** on the menu.

Profisee automatically aligns the source columns to the corresponding attribute columns. Only columns that were pasted will be updated when published to Profisee.

The Paste Append right-click option is only available for workspace attribute groups containing the Code column.
