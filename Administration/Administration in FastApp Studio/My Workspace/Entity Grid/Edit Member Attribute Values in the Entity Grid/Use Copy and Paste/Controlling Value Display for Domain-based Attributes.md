# Controlling Value Display for Domain-based Attributes

To change settings affecting the edit behavior of domain-based attributes in the entity grid, navigate to **Settings | Desktop Settings | Entity**.

**Edit mode**--Two options are available: **Popup** and **AutoComplete**. These options affect the way you select domain-based attribute values when the **Number of domain-based attributes in list** is exceeded--if the list is too long to be practical as a drop-down list, for example.

- **Popup**: Opens a pop-up window containing all of the members for the DBA. Scroll through possible values and select the value you want to use. The pop-up window contains tools to filter and sort values, change the number of values displayed at once, and create new values by adding new members to the referenced entity.
- **AutoComplete**: Attempts to complete the attribute value as you type. Click outside of the cell when the correct value appears to select it.

**Always check for changes**: See [Common User Actions in Settings](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/common_user_actions_in_desktop_settings) for setting details.

**List Limit** -- Enter the desired value in the free-text field.
