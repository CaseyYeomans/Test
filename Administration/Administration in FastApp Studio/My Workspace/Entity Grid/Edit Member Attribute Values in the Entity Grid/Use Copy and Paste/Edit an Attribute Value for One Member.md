# Edit an Attribute Value for One Member

To edit an attribute value for a single member:

1. Open an Entity view tab.
2. Select the cell you want to edit in the entity grid.
- For a **Text**, **Number**, or **Link** free-form attribute, type the new value for the cell or paste a copied value from the clipboard.
- For a **DateTime** free-form attribute, click the cell again and type the new date, or click the arrow to select a new date from the pop-up calendar.
- For a **domain-based attribute** (DBA), select a new value from the menu. Alternatively, paste a new value into the cell and, when you publish the edited data, you will be prompted to confirm adding this new value to the entity that makes up the domain.
3. When using live publishing mode, select a different cell to exit the editing mode and save your changes. When using deferred publishing mode, click **Publish** in the entity grid toolbar to save your changes.
