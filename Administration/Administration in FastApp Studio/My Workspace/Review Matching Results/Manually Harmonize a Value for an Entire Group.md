# Manually Harmonize a Value for an Entire Group

To manually harmonize the attribute values for all source records in the group (update all values for an attribute from the golden record):

1. Open a Matching Results view tab. For more information, see [Viewing matching results](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_matching_results).
2. Select a member in the top grid to display a match group in the bottom grid.
3. Right-click the value in the golden record containing the desired attribute value.
4. Select **Harmonize this Column** on the menu.

The selected attribute value is copied to all group members from the golden record.

The golden record must contain a value for the attribute before it can be harmonized. If a group does not have a golden record, you cannot promote or harmonize values for those group members. Run the survivorship portion of your strategy again to create golden records for any groups that do not have golden records.
