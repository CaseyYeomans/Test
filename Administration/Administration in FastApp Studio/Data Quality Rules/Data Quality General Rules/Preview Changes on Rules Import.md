# Preview Changes on Rules Import

When you import rules, the system compares the rules in the file being imported against the rules that are currently stored on the server.

Click **Import/ Export**. The Select a publishing option window opens. Select an option and click **OK**.

## Merge Rules

Imported rules are merged with existing rules. If there are no conflicts, new rules appear in the list of existing rules.

## Replace Rules

The dialog contains three elements to help you understand the change you are about to publish.

1. **Rules Tree**: The rules tree in the left pane displays the list of rules, by entity and attribute, that are impacted by the import process. When you select an attribute rule, the proposed change is shown in detail in the right pane. The icon to the left of the attribute name identifies the proposed change to the rule for that attribute.
2. **Current Rule Panel**: The top panel on the right displays the current rule definition (if one exists) on the server.
3. **Updated Rule Panel**: The bottom panel on the right displays the rule as it will exist after publishing is complete.

This dialog displays the changes that are going to be made if you continue with publishing. It does not allow you to select which changes you want or would like to omit.
