# Hierarchy Designer Overview

Define and build hierarchical relationships to provide enhanced presentation and editing experiences in applications using the Hierarchy Designer. The designer provides an interface for the creation of new parent (superordinate), child (subordinate), and recursive Relationships. You can extend a DBA to a parent, child, or recursive Relationship. This is the same action available at the attribute level as [Extend to Relationship](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/extend_to_relationship_overview) at the attribute level in Advanced Modeling. The focus in the Hierarchy Designer is the entity rather than the attribute.

Launch the Hierarchies Designer from the Hierarchies tab under the Administration menu of Profisee FastApps Studio. Like other administration tabs, the Hierarchy Designer contains a list view displaying all defined hierarchies in the model. In addition to the list view, the Hierarchy Designer includes an edit panel with a hierarchy visualizer and a configuration and properties panel. With these tools, you can edit, create, and update hierarchies.
