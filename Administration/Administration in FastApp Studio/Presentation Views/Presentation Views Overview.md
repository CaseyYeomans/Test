# Presentation Views Overview

Presentation views are reusable entity grid configurations for use with portal page controls in FastApps. They include multiple display options, including attribute columns, filtering and sorting information, display format, page size, and optional information such as the display format of DBAs, the default page size, and whether the validation column displays.

Presentation views add a layer of customization to the portal page, controlling the rows and columns of the entity grid visible to the user. Views are generally used to focus, simplify, and customize how individual users view the entity grid.

During configuration, the presentation view display format also controls the DBA filter display in the portal. Therefore, you should not use display format of 'Name' (without code) when blank values exist for Name.
