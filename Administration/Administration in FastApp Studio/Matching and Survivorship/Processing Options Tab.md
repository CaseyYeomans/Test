# Processing Options Tab

![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-if87a9651430f86.png)Continuous Matching allows for automatic processing of a matching strategy without needing to manually run the matching strategy. Once you have created a matching strategy, you can determine whether to use continuous matching to automatically process changed records or use On Demand matching instead, in which the strategy only runs when prompted by a user. While continuous matching is enabled, changes made to the model will cause the continuous matching strategy to automatically be disabled.

1. Navigate to the **Matching and Survivorship** tab in Profisee FastApp Studio.
2. Either create a new strategy or edit an existing matching strategy, then navigate to the **Processing Options** tab.
3. Select any of the following options to determine your continuous matching settings.

- **Disabled** (Default) - Stops Automatic Indexing. Cancels a running strategy
- **Enabled** - Starts Automatic Indexing. Optionally, select either of the optional sub-settings below.
- Automatically identify clusters for uncluttered records.
- Automatically perform survivorship as data is created, updated, and deleted.
