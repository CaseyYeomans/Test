# Data Mapping with Open AI

While configuring strategies in connect, you can automatically map requests to their proper attributes using the **Auto Assign** feature. The Open AI-powered Attribute Assistant allows you to enter plain-text prompts to perform data mapping instantly and automatically. You must [configure your instance for use with Open AI](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/open_AI) to use this feature. Users with Open AI compatibility should see this feature without any additional configuration.

If the data mapping results contain errors, either run the Auto Assign feature again with a modified prompt, or manually correct the errant data mappings.
