# Creating and Mapping Attributes with the Attribute Assistant

While configuring strategies in Connect, you may encounter a scenario where you must map responses to attributes within an entity that has no pre-existing attributes. While you can manually create new attributes to use for this strategy, the AI Assistant can also automatically create and map attributes to match the responses of your strategy.

1. Navigate to **Profisee Portal** > **Administration** > **Connect** > **Strategies** > **Response 200**.
2. Click the AI Assistant button in the Mapping Response pane.
3. Select **Create Attributes and Map**. The Attribute Assistant opens as a popup.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-icd3a61e51bd9deb5.png)
4. Type a plain text description of the attributes you want to create. A simple example could be, "Create attributes that match the names of the responses in this strategy."
5. Click **Run**.
6. Review the created attributes. If there are manual changes you wish to make, click any of the newly created attributes to manually make changes to the metadata. Alternatively, enter a new text prompt and click **Try Again** to run a new prompt from scratch.
7. Click **Accept**once you are satisfied with the created attributes.
8. Click **Save** to save the created attributes.

Your entity should now contain the attributes required to map onto your strategy. You can then use the AI Assistant to automatically map the attributes, or click **Save and Close** to exit.
