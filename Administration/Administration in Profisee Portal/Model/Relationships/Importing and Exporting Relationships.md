# Importing and Exporting Relationships

You can import and export relationships to quickly exchange metadata between different instances of Profisee. The Export function allows you to export all relationships, or only selected relationships as a .json.

To export relationships in portal:

1. Navigate to the **Model** header, then the **Relationships** tab in the Administrator view or Profisee portal.
2. Click the vertical ellipsis on the toolbar. If you have no relationships selected, the **Export (All)** function will be available. If you have one or more relationships selected, the Export **(Selected)** function will be available.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-ia007fb4aeb0ef2fa.png)
3. A file containing the relationship list is downloaded.

To Import a file, click the **Import** icon instead, then select a .json file on your machine containing a relationship list.
