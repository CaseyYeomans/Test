# Importing and Exporting Entities in Profisee Portal

You can import and export entities to quickly exchange sets of data between different instances of Profisee. The Export function allows you to export all entities (or only selected entities) as a .json file.

To export a collection of entities in portal:

1. Navigate to the Modeling tab in the Administrator view or Profisee portal.
2. Click the vertical ellipsis on the toolbar. If you have no entities selected, the **Export (All)** function will be available. If you have one or more entities selected, the **Export** **(Selected)** function will be available.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-ia007fb4aeb0ef2fa.png)
3. A file containing the entities is downloaded.

To import one or more entities into Profisee, click the **Import** function from the vertical ellipsis menu and select a .json file containing entities saved to your machine. If the imported entities contain items with exceptions, the following screen will appear.

- **Skip** these items, preventing them from being imported.
- **Overwrite** these items, merging them with existing items in the entities.
- **Cancel** the import entirely.
