# Use the Events Dashboards

Both the Profisee Events Dashboard and the External Events Dashboard provide details about triggering events and their processing status. Select the relevant dashboard to view statistics for Profisee or external events, which includes:

## Queued Messages

Displays information about triggering events that are waiting to be processed by an event consuming server.

## Processed Messages

Displays information about triggering events that have already been processed by the event consuming server.

## Failed Messages

Displays information about triggering events that the event consumer was able to process, but, when the event consumer contacted the subscriber, an error was returned by the subscriber.

## Viewing Statistics

By using the Date Range 1 and Date Range 2 menus, you can select two periods of time to compare the number of messages that were processed or which failed during those times. The Queued Messages panel is not affected by the date range selections, as that panel displays only the current information for queued messages.

**Date Range 1** and **Date Range 2**, as well as all counts displayed,are based on the timezone set for the server and are not affected by the client's timezone.
