# Troubleshoot Common Validation Issues for Data Transfer Strategies

Several common issues are responsible for the failure of data transfer strategies when configuring properties for the Data Transfer Controller subscriber.

**Issue**: Mapped attribute types in the data transfer strategy are not compatible between the source and target.

- To fix this, open the data transfer strategy in Profisee Integrator (formerly Federation Manager), and update the attribute mappings to compatible types between the two systems.

**Issue**: There is an issue connecting with the source or target server in the data transfer strategy when validation occurs.

- Make sure you can access both systems before attempting to validate the subscriber properties.
