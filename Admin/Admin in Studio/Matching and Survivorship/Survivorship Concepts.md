# Survivorship Concepts

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Survivorship Set** | **Behavior** | **Use** | **Example** |
| Attributes | Each set contains all attributes related to each other to represent a piece of data that will be promoted to the golden record from a single source record. Multiple sets are used to separate different pieces of data, or when different promotion criteria are needed. | More sets will take longer to process, so only add attributes required to be in the Golden record like Name, Email, Phone, Address, Etc. Source System ID, Source Updated Date, etc. should not be used as they pertain to the source record only. Address Verification Status, Match Status, etc. are not Golden record data but only qualify the source record. | Set1: First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name Set2: Address Line 1, City, State, ZipCode, Country Set3: Phone Number, Phone Extension Set4: Email All represent a single piece of data that should be promoted from a single source record. |
| Apply nulls | A null attribute value in the source record will overwrite a populated value in the golden record. | Use when you must match the source record exactly, even if you lose values from the golden record. | Email - Apply Nulls Checked: If the golden record has an email for a person, but the source record has null, the golden records email will be overwritten with a null. |
| **Promotion & Harmonization Behavior** | **Behavior** | **Use** | **Example** |
| Always Copy/Overwrite | All set attributes in the golden record are updated regardless if they have blank values or not. | Use when you want to update the golden records with the newest/best data every time. | Set: Address, City, State, Zip: Golden record: Null, Null, GA, 30024 Source: Null, Duluth, GA, 30097 New Golden record: Null, Duluth, GA, 30097 |
| Only copy if the attribute is blank | Set attributes in the golden record with blank values are updated, but populated ones are not. | Use when you want to update the golden records only when data is missing. Does not overwrite the original value with a new/updated value. | Set: Address, City, State, Zip: Golden record: Null, Null, GA, 30024 Source: Null, Duluth, GA, 30097 New Golden record: Null, Duluth, GA, 30024 |
| Only Copy if all attributes are blank | All set attribute values in the golden record must be blank to be updated. | Use only when the golden record has no values. Golden records with any value populated will not get updated at all. | Set: Address, City, State, Zip: Golden record: Null, Null, GA, 30024 Source: Null, Duluth, GA, 30097 New Golden record: Null, Null, GA, 30024 |
| Promotion & Harmonization Condition | Filters out records to be excluded from Promotion or Harmonization. | Use when you want to keep golden records the way stewards set them manually, and not overwrite them, or to exclude certain child records to be updated with the golden record values. | Promotion Condition: Flag attribute does not equal Reviewed: Records flagged as Reviewed are not processed/updated. Harmonization Condition: Source does not equal Salesforce: Source records from Salesforce are not updated. |
| **Promotion Criteria** | **Behavior** | **Use** | **Example** |
| Evaluating Criteria | The selected criteria are evaluated in order of Filter, Sort, Completeness, Occurrence, Recency until a single record is chosen to promote all set attribute values from. | Evaluate each set and use only the criteria that apply to the attributes in the set. | See below for each criterion: |
| Filter | Filters the child records to only leave the ones that should be used for promoting values. | Use when you want to eliminate specific records from being used for promotion, or to only use specific records. If all records in the group are filtered out, promotion will not happen. | Address Verification Status = "Verified" OR Match Status <> "Proposed" |
| Sort | Sorts by the chosen priority to pick the one record to promote from. | Use when you want to prioritize one record over another. If the highest priority is not available in the group, choose the next priority, and so on. | SourceSystem.Priority - Ascending (uses a custom numeric Priority field in the source system attribute to prefer one system over another for promotion. Chooses priority 1 over 2 over 3, etc.) OR SouceLastUpdatedDate - Descending (Uses the last updated date of the records from the originating source system from newest to oldest) |
| Completeness | Counts the number of populated vs null values in the set attributes, with the one with the most populated values as the winner. | Use when you have multiple attributes in the set and some of them can be blank to choose the most populated one. The length of the values is not considered; all values count the same. | Set: Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, Zip, Country. Winner: 3655 Brookside Pkwy, Suite 175, Alpharetta, GA, 30024. Loser: 3655 Brookside Parkway, NULL, Alpharetta, GA, 30024. |
| Occurrence | Counts the number of times the value or combination of values repeats in the group and picks the one with the most occurrences. | Use when you have groups of 3 or more records. If the majority of groups are 1 or 2 records, there will not be a winner. Use mainly for single attribute sets, the combination of many attributes will most often be unique and not occur multiple times. | Set: First Name, Last Name. Values: "John Smith", "Jon Smith", "John Smithe", "John Smith". Value Count: "John Smith" (2), "Jon Smith" (1), "John Smithe" (1) |
| Recency - Newest of Last Updated On OR Oldest of Created On | Chooses the latest updated record or the first created record in Profisee. Always on - used as a last tiebreaker. | Use when you prefer to take the latest value updated in Profisee, or the original value on creation in Profisee. If all are equal, the record with the first code value is used. | Newest of Last Updated on: 1/1/2025 12:00:00 > 12/31/2024 11:59:00 |
