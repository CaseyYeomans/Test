# Workflow Administration Overview

The **Workflow** administration tab in Profisee FastApp studio allows an administrator to configure and manage workflows that have been [designed and built](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/developing_a_workflow) in Visual Studio. This step in the lifecycle of a workflow ensures that the workflow is properly set up, assigns tasks from that workflow to participants, and finally launches the workflow. The general steps in this process are as follows:

1. [Register](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/registering_workflows) the .XAML file containing your workflow.
2. [Configure](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_workflows) your registered workflow.
3. If applicable, [assign tasks to workflow participants](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/assigning_tasks_to_workflow_participants).
4. [Initiate](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/manually_initiating_workflows) your configured workflow.

Once a workflow has been initiated, you can [view and manage](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/viewing_and_managing_workflow_activity) workflow and task activities, [enable and disable](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/enable_and_disable_a_workflow) a workflow at will, and [configure real-time event processing](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_configuration_for_the_workflow_subscriber_) for workflows.
