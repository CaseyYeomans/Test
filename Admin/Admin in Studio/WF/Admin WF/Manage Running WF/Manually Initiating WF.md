# Manually Initiating Workflows

Workflows can be started manually from the Workflow administration tab in Profisee FastApp Studio. This capability allows for quick and easy testing of your workflows in a development or testing environment. In a production environment, you should consider using one of the options for [automatically starting workflows](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/options_for_starting_workflows). Before you can initiate a workflow in this way, you must ensure the workflow is [registered](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/register_workflow), [configured](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_a_workflow), and enabled.

1. Navigate to the Workflow tab in Profisee FastApp Studio.
2. Select the workflow you want to start.
3. Right-click the workflow and select **Initiate**.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/StaticAsset/Read/file-i84e423d1f2d8aa60.png)
4. Enter the code of the member on which you want this workflow to initiate.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/StaticAsset/Read/file-i9de03f61aa855d41.png)

If initiating a template workflow, you can select an Entity Name from a dropdown containing all entities that are associated with the template.
