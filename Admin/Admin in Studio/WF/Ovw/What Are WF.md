# What Are Workflows?

A workflow is typically a long-running process composed of activities. An activity is an object configured in Visual Studio which performs a function, according to the way it is coded and configured. When workflows are initiated, tasks are produced by configured activities. Tasks require one or more users to input information for the task to complete. The users that are assigned to perform a task are called participants.

Each task associated to a participant is called a task assignment. If one task is associated with five participants, a single instance of the task is created, but five instances of the task assignment are created (one assignment for each of the five participants). The assignments track the participation of users in the workflow process.

Workflows support data governance processes. The following types of processes may be involved:

- Specifying the details of a new product
- Correcting issues identified through business rules
- Correcting address issues identified by verification services (such as Melissa Data or Google)
- Resolving duplicate record data such as customers or products

The requirements of these processes are supplied through tasks assigned to data stewards within the organization. Tasks can include: adding and updating record data; approving record data additions and updates contributed by other users; approving match results; other activities related to approving, rejecting or saving changes to member data.
