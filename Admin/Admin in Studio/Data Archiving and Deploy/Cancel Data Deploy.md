# Cancel Data Deployment

To cancel data deployment:

1. In the Data Deployment Status dialog, click **Cancel**.
2. Click **Yes** to confirm the canceling.

The Data Deployment Status dialog closes.

Any data that deploys before you click Cancel is already written to the model. Clicking Cancel prevents additional data from deploying, but it does not undo any data that has already deployed.
