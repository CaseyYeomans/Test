# Process an Archiving Strategy

Processing an archiving strategy creates an archive of the data for the model objects defined by the strategy.

To process a strategy:

1. In the navigation panel, under Administration, click **Data Archiving and Deployment**.
2. On the Data Archiving and Deployment tab, click **Archive data**.
3. Select the strategy.
4. On the strategy edit toolbar, click **Process**.

The Save As dialog appears.
5. Browse to a location to save the archive file.

Archive files are saved by default on the client, with the file extension `*.archive`.

6. Enter a name for the file.
7. Click **Save**.

The strategy processes, creating a compressed archive file with the file extension \*.archive in the selected location.

To cancel the archiving process at any point, close the Archive Data Status dialog.

8. When the Summary line appears in bold in the dialog, close the Archive Data Status dialog.

The archive is complete and ready to deploy.

Archiving proceeds very quickly compared to the speed of deployment. Depending on the amount of data and available hardware, your strategy could take an hour to process, while deploying the data could potentially take more than a day. For best results, be sure to follow the guidelines in [Configure Settings for Archiving and Deployment](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_settings_for_archiving_and_deployment) and [Best Practices for Data Archiving and Deployment](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/best_practices_for_data_archiving_and_deployment).
