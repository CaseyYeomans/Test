# Edit an Archiving Strategy

An archiving strategy defines the model objects and the version data to save to an archive file when the strategy processes.

To edit an existing archiving strategy:

You can edit any aspect of an archiving strategy.

1. In the navigation panel, under Administration, click **Data Archiving and Deployment**.
2. On the Data Archiving and Deployment tab, click **Archive data**.
3. Select the strategy.
4. On the Data Archiving toolbar, click **Edit**.

The edit panel opens.
5. Edit the strategy.

You can edit the following areas of an archiving strategy:

- Name
- **Filter by Last Updated On** selections
- Version
- Model objects to archive

You can edit any aspect of an archiving strategy.

6. Click **Save and Close**.

The next time you process the strategy, the archive will be created with the new settings.

If you attempt to edit a strategy for an entity that does not exist on the current Profisee server, you are given the option to delete the strategy. Because your desktop may connect to multiple Profisee servers, make sure it is appropriate to delete the strategy before doing so.
