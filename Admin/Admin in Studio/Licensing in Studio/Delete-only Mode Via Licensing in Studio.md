Licensing limitations affect how many attributes or records you can add to an entity. Once the limit is reached, you will only be able to delete attributes or records.

The error message window below displays, and additions to either attributes or records is disabled.

If you try to create a record while in violation, you will not be able to save it.

If the license is upgraded to include more attributes or records, or the number is reduced so the total falls below the license threshold, normal edit capabilities are available again.
