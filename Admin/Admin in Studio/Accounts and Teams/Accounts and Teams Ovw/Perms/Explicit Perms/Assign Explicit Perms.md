# Assign Explicit Permissions

Explicit Permissions are assigned directly by a Permission Administrator and stored in the repository.

Assign Explicit Permissions at both the A[ccount](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/accounts_overview) and [Team](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/teams_overview) level.

For all explicit assignments:

1. Under Administration, click **Accounts and Teams**.
2. Do one of the following:

1. Click A**ccounts**.
2. Select the account in the list.

**--or --**

3. Click **Teams**.

Select the team in the list.
4. The Team edit panel opens.

3. Click the **Permissions** tab.

5. Right-click the object in the model where you want to make the assignment.
6. Click the Explicit Permission to assign.
