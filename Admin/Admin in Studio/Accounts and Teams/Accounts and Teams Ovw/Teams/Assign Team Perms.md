# Assign Team Permissions

Assign permissions to teams where possible instead of assigning the same permissions to multiple accounts. Managing permissions is simpler and more efficient at the team level.

To assign permissions to a team:

1. Under Administration, click **Accounts and Teams**.
2. Click **Teams**.
3. In the list, select the account.
4. In the Teams toolbar, click **Edit**.

The Teams edit panel opens.
5. Click the **Permissions** tab.
6. Click **Edit**.

The Edit Permissions dialog appears.
7. Right-click the entities in the tree to make explicit permission assignments at the entity level.

The following permissions are available at the entity level:

- No Access
- Read
- Update
- Update Create
- Update Create Delete
- Administration

For more information, see [Permissions Overview](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/permissions_overview).
8. Expand the individual entity nodes to access the attributes, and then right-click the attributes to make explicit permission assignments at the attribute level.

The following permissions are available at the attribute level:

- No Access
- Read
- Update
9. Under the **Filters** node, edit the Read Filter and the Update Filter to enforce row-based security.
10. Click Save to save the permission assignments.
11. Click **Save and Close** when you have finished assigning permissions to the team.
