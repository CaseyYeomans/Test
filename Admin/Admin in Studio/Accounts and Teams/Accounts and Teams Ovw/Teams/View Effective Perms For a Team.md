# View Effective Permissions For a Team

View effective permissions for a team:

1. In the navigation panel, Under Administration, click **Accounts and Teams**.
2. Click **Teams**.
3. Select a team in the list of teams.
4. In the Teams toolbar, click **View**.
5. Click **Effective Permissions** in the menu.

The Effective Permissions dialog appears.

The selected team has some type of permission to any objects appearing in bold in the dialog. The permission appearing to the right of the model object is the team's effective permission to that model object.

Because teams do not inherit permissions from other teams, team effective permissions are those explicitly assigned to the team, plus any implied permissions to domain entities obtained through permissions to entities containing domain-based attributes.
