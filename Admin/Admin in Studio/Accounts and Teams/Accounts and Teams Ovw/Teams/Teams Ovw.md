# Teams Overview

A **team** is a group of accounts defined within the Profisee Platform. Teams are useful for assignment of similar Roles and Permissions to a group of accounts as well as assigning tasks and routing of notifications to a group of accounts.

Open the Teams tab under Accounts and Teams to create groups and add accounts (see Accounts Overview).

Create functional account groupings to assign specific administrative or data steward tasks such as workflow participantion, creating and processing Address Verification strategies, or accessing Analytics reports (see [Sharing Analytics reports with Profisee teams](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/share_analytics_reports_with_teams)).

Assign roles and permissions to teams to easily apply the same security settings to multiple accounts, avoiding redundancy.

You can import and export teams between instances. Account memberships are always included in the export files, but are optional when importing. Teams can be imported with or without account assignments as needed.

The Teams tab displays the following information:

| **Column Name** | **Description** |
| **Name** | The display name for the team |
