# Define Node Properties in the Hierarchy Designer

After Relationships are placed into the hierarchy, you can configure node properties through the Options tab in the Hierarchy Designer. Node properties determine how the hierarchy appears in Profisee FastApps Portal, and defines how data stewards can interact with it.

Each node in the hierarchy can and often does have different properties because, in most cases, each node represents a different entity and member type.

The Options Tab contains important settings affecting display and interaction with the hierarchy in FastApps Portal, including the presentation view, the behavior of forms, and member edit parameters. Different settings can be applied to each node of the hierarchy if the appropriate presentation views and forms have been created.
