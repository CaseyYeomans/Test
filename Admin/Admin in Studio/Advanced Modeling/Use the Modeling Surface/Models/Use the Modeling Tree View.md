# Use the Modeling Tree View

Icons in the tree view include:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | Model |
| | Entity |
| | Edited Entity |
| | Attribute |
| | Edited Attribute |

Open the modeling tree view to display models and their components in a drag-and-drop interface. There are two types of nodes in the tree view:

- Containers

Containers do not represent model objects and simply organize related objects. The containers in the tree view are: Entities and Attributes.
- Objects

Objects relate to model components, including models, entities, and attributes. Objects can contain other objects or other containers. For example, an entity object contains the Attributes container.

- To move an object within the tree view, click the object that you want to move and drag it to a new location.
- To make changes to an object, right-click the object and click an option in the menu.

For more information on working with objects, see additional references in [Use the modeling grid](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/use_the_modeling_grid). Hover over objects in the model tree to view additional details about the object.
