# Use the Modeling Grid

Open the modeling grid to work with a flat view of the same objects that appear in the modeling tree view pane. Displayed information correlates with the selected object in the tree view pane. Select a container object, such as Attributes. The grid will list the attributes in the selected Attributes container. Select a specific object, such as an individual attribute, to view detailed information on that object.

Pin an object or a container in the tree view to keep the same view in the grid while you scroll to a different area of the tree. Use the feature to easily copy objects from one model to another.

## Pin Columns

Pin columns to hold focus on a particular column while scrolling through other columns in the grid.

To pin a column, click the pin icon in the column header.

You can reorder the modeling grid columns, but you cannot change the order of pinned columns. Unpin a pinned column first before attempting to move it.

## Sort Columns

Sort data in the grid using the column sort options.

1. In the modeling grid, click the column header of the column you want to sort.

The up arrow icon displays in the column heading.
2. Click the column heading so that the arrow points in the correct direction (pointing downward for descending sorts; pointing upward for ascending sorts).

The grid refreshes the column according to the sort selection.

By default, grid data is sorted alphabetically by the Name column for entities and by the Order column for attributes.

## Drag and Drop from the Tree

Drag objects in the tree view pane to move them to a new location in the same model.

## Right-click Menu and Toolbar

Access object options (adding, deleting, editing, copying, and pasting) using the right-click menu or the toolbar in the modeling grid.

## Re-ordering Columns

The columns in the modeling grid display object properties.

Columns can be re-ordered so it is easier to focus on specific properties, place related properties adjacent to each other, or move less important properties to less visible positions. You can temporarily change the position of properties in the modeling grid by clicking and dragging the columns.

To move a column, click in the column header and drag it to its new location.
