# Create a New Model

There is one system model in Profisee Platform. Any model published from Advanced Modeling overwrites this model on the server. You can, however, create additional models and save them as files.

Create a new model using Advanced Modeling:

- Click **New** on the modeling toolbar.

A new model file is created with a default name. Change the name as desired before saving.

If you publish a model from the modeling surface, it will overwrite the system model. Review the Publish to Server dialog carefully before proceeding.
