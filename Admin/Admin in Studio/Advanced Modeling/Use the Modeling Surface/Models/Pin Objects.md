# Pin Objects

Pinning lets you hold a group of model objects in a fixed position view while you scroll through the tree view to another location.

Drag a new component to the pinned object while the model is pinned. With several models open in the tree view pane, pin the Entities container of one model, scroll to another model, and then drag a new entity into the first model.You can also pin the Attributes container of one model and drag an attribute from another model to the pinned location. Pinning is also useful for comparing model objects that are not physically near one another in the tree view.

To pin an object in a model:

1. In the model tree, select the object that you want to pin.
2. In the grid pane, click the above the grid.

You can pin any object in a model, including models, entities, and attributes.
