# Create a Recursive Attribute Relationship for an Entity

Create a recursive attribute relationship using Advanced Modeling:

1. Expand the model to the **Entities** container.
2. Expand **Entities**.
3. In the model tree, select the entity that will have the recursive attribute.
4. Drag the entity to the **Attributes** container under the same entity object.

The entity now appears as an attribute for itself in the Attributes container.

You can now change the name of the attribute to better reflect the relationship role. For more information, see [Editing attributes](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/edit_attributes)[.](https://profisee.magentrixcloud.com/wikis/profiseeplatform_v7/edit_attributes)
