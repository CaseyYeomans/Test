# Make Copies of Attributes

Advanced Modeling allows you to copy attributes between entities in the same model or in different models. You can also copy an attribute within the same entity to create a similar attribute.

Make a copy of an attribute in another model using the tree view:

1. Expand the model to the **Entities** container.
2. Expand **Entities**.
3. Expand the entity containing the attribute you want to copy.
4. Expand **Attributes**.
5. Select the attribute that you want to copy in the tree view pane.
6. Drag the attribute and drop it on another entity or the **Attributes** container under another entity.

The new attribute appears in the entity.
7. Right-click the attribute and then click **Edit** on the menu to edit the attribute.

The available options to edit an unpublished attribute are the same as those available for creating a new attribute. For more information, see [Create Attributes](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_attributes).
8. Click **Save**.

To make a copy an attribute within the same entity using the tree view:

1. Expand the top level of the model.
2. Expand **Entities**.
3. Expand the entity containing the attribute you want to copy.
4. Expand **Attributes**.
5. Select the attribute that you want to copy in the tree view pane.
6. Drag the attribute and drop it on the **Attributes** container within the same entity.

A new attribute is created with the same name as the original with "copy" appended to it.
7. Right-click the attribute and click **Edit** on the menu to edit the attribute.

The available options to edit an unpublished attribute are the same as those available for creating a new attribute.
8. Click **Save**.

You can make copies of multiple attributes at a time by using CTRL+Click or SHIFT+Click.
