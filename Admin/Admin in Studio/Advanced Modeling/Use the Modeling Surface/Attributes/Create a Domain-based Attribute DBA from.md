# Create a Domain-based Attribute (DBA) from an Entity

Advanced Modeling provides a quick way to add a domain-based attribute (DBA) to an existing entity.

Add a DBA to an entity:

1. Expand the top level of the model.
2. Select the source entity in the model that will be the reference (domain) entity for the DBA. The domain entity provides the list of possible values for the attribute.
3. Drag the source entity to the target entity where you want to add the DBA.

The source entity is now referenced by a DBA under the target entity. You can expand the target entity, and then expand the Attributes container to view new DBA. Now you can change the name of the attribute to properly reflect the role of the relationship.
