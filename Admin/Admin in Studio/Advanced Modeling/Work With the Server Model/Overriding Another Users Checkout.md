# Overriding Another User's Checkout

When a user checks out a model, that model displays to other users as checked out to indicate that someone is editing it. If a user leaves the company, goes on vacation, or just forgets to check a model back in, that user's checkout can be released by another user.

To release a checkout for a different user for a model:

1. On the Advanced Modeling tab, click the **Open** menu.
2. Click **Open from Server** on the menu.

The "Check out the model from the server" dialog displays. The user who has checked out the model is indicated in the message.
3. Select **Release the current checkout and check out the model yourself**.

Click **OK**.

The current checkout is released. The model is now checked out to the current user.

When a model is checked out, it cannot be edited in any area of the application. This includes editing or adding any metadata like attributes and to all options relating to Adaptive Modeling. Checking out a model puts a lock on the model to prevent multiple users from making conflicting changes to the model.

As a best practice, first check with anyone who currently has a checked out model before overriding the checkout.
