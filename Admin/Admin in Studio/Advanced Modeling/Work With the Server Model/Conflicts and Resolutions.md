# Conflicts and Resolutions

Conflicts can occur in modeling when you attempt to publish changes using the Merge models option. You are prompted to resolve conflicts when it is unclear which objects in the target model (on the server) should be associated with source model (in the modeling surface) information. The two identifiers for any object are the Name and Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). A conflict occurs when it is not possible to determine the intended target using the Name and GUID of the object you are trying to publish. Conflict resolution gives you the opportunity to clarify mappings and avoid unintentional model changes based on incorrect assumptions.

If you plan your model carefully, you will never need to resolve a conflict. However, correctly resolving conflicts can prevent model update errors and data loss that could occur by accidentally overwriting the wrong model objects. If you do encounter a conflict, and you are uncertain which resolution to choose, you can always close the Publish to Server dialog and edit the source model again.

The following are examples of possible conflicts that can occur when you publish:

| Action: | Conflict caused by: | Example: | Options for resolution: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attempting to save an entity to the server model | The server model contains an entity with the same Name as an entity in the source model, but the GUIDs do not match. The GUID for the source entity matches another entity in the server model, but the names do not match. | You open the system model from the server. You edit the entity Class and change the name to Style. In the same model, you edit the entity Style and change the name to Class. When you publish the model, there is a conflict because the entity names and GUIDs do not match the server versions. | Associate by ID to entity: Name1 Associates the source entity with the target entity called Name1. Associate by name to entity: Name2 Associates the source entity with the target entity called Name2. |
| Attempting to save an entity to the server model | The server model contains an entity with the same name as the entity in the source model, but the GUIDs do not match. | You open the system model from the server. You delete the entity Class, and then you create a new entity and name it Class. When you publish, there is a conflict because the entity Class on the server has a different GUID than the entity with the same name in your source model. | Update target entity: Name1 Associates the source entity with the target entity based on the name. Create a new entity Creates a new entity in the target model with a new name. If the Create a new entity option is selected, the existing entity will be tagged for deletion. Deletion can be skipped before publishing. |
| Attempting to save an attribute to the server model | The server model contains an attribute that has the same Name as an attribute in the source model, but with a different GUID. The target model also has an attribute with the same GUID as an attribute in the source, but with a different name. | You open the system model from the server. In the City entity, you rename the Region attribute to StateProvince and rename the StateProvince attribute to Region. When you publish the edited model, there is a conflict because the Region and StateProvince attributes in the same context in the target model do not have the same GUIDs as those in the source. | Associate by ID to attribute: Name1 Associates the source attribute with the target attribute with Name1. Associate by Name to attribute: Name2 Associates the source attribute with the target attribute with Name2. |
| Attempting to save an attribute to the server model | The target entity contains an attribute with the same name as an attribute in the source model, but with a different GUID. | You open the system model from the server. In the entity Product, you delete the attribute Color. You add a new attribute in the Product entity and name it Color. When you publish the edited model, there is a conflict because the GUID for the Color attribute will not match in the source and on the target. | Update target attribute: Name1 Associates the source attribute with the target attribute based on the name. Create a new attribute Create as new attribute in the server model with a new name. |
