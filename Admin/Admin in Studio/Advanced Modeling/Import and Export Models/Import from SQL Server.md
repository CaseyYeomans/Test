# Import from SQL Server

Import a model into Advanced Modeling from SQL Server:

1. Click **Import** on the modeling toolbar.
2. Click **Import from SQL Server** on the menu.

The **Import from SQL Server** dialog appears.
3. In the **Server name** field, type the name of the SQL server.

Alternatively, you can click the arrow in the Server Name field and wait for the list of servers available on your network to populate. Be aware that this process can take a long time to complete if there are numerous servers in your environment. If you know the name of the server you want to access, it is often faster to type the name into the field instead of selecting the server from the populated list.

4. From the **Authentication** list, select either **Windows Authentication** or **SQL Authentication**.
5. Click **Connect** to access the selected server.
6. From the **Database name** list, select the name of the database you want to import.
7. Click **OK**.

The model opens in the modeling surface.
