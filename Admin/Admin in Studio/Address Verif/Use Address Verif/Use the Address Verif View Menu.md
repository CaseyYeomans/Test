# Use the Address Verification View Menu

The View menu on the Address Verification tab lets you view:

- **Results Summary**

Shows the most recent results for the currently selected address verification strategy.
- **Related Entity**

Opens the entity for the selected strategy in a workspace tab.
- **Strategy Status**

Displays the last status for the selected strategy.
- **Operational Statuses of Services**

Displays the functional status of the different verification services.

If you have included licenses for both Bing and Google, only the status for Google displays.

- **Transaction Usage**

Displays available transactions and licensed international regions.

If you have applied a license key purchased directly from Loqate, information about transactions does not display in the Transaction Usage dialog. You must view and manage your transactions using the Loqate site.
