# Select Users to Access Address Services

On the Users tab, you can give individual users the right to access Address Services. Only users in this list will be able to process address strategies or perform interactive address lookups.

1. Navigate to **Administration | Accounts and Teams | Users**.
2. Select a user account.
3. In the Users toolbar, click **Edit**.
4. Click the **Roles** tab.
5. Select the **Address Verification User** role in the Available roles pane. Users with the Address Verification Administrator role can edit strategies as well as process them.
6. Click the right arrow to add the role to the Assigned roles pane.
7. Click **Save** to apply the new settings.

Address Services access can also be assigned to Profisee teams using the same procedure on the Teams tab. If more than one user needs access to the feature, it is recommended that you assign the role to a team and add the users to that team.
