# Data Quality Rules Overview

Data Quality Rules provide the golden record data governance team the ability to specify characteristics of what defines good data quality. Use data quality rules to evaluate golden record data and flag attribute values in golden record data entities as either passing or failing.

Super Administrators can manage data quality rules through the Data Quality Rules administration tab in FastApps Studio. You can perform the following activities from the Data Quality Rules administration tab:

- [View Data Quality Rules](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_data_quality_rules)
- [Add Data Quality Rules](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/add_data_quality_rules)
- [Edit Data Quality Rules](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/edit_data_quality_rules)

## Rule Types

There are two types of data quality rules: Validation rules and assignment rules.

### Validation Rules

A data quality validation rule for an attribute validates an existing value. It is composed of one or more clauses, defined in a specific order. Additional clauses are created by clicking the **Plus** icon in the **Clauses** toolbar.

### Assignment Rules

An assignment rule clause sets the value of an attribute based on particular conditions. An assignment rule for an attribute is composed of one or more clauses, defined in a specific order. Additional clauses are created by clicking the **Plus**icon in the **Clauses** toolbar. Like validation clauses, the clauses are evaluated in the order that they appear in the clauses grid. The assignment clause applied is the first clause that passes the specified **When** condition.

## Rule Structure

Data quality rules are defined for a specific attribute of a golden record data entity. A rule consists of one or more clauses. A clause consists of the following elements:

- Assertion: An assertion defines the statement that must be true for the clause to pass. A clause has one and only one assertion. For a complete list of supported assertions, see [Data Quality Rule Operators](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/data_quality_rule_operators).
- Parameters: Each assertion type has its own parameter requirements. Some assertions, such as **is required**, require no parameters while others such as **must equal** require a single parameter. Parameters can be constant values or they can be references to other attributes on the same entity or referenced through a domain-based attribute (DBA) on the same or different entity.
- Condition: Each clause can have a single, optional, filter-based condition. The assertion only applies to those records that meet the condition.

## Rule Evaluation

Rules are active when created, but will only be used to evaluate data that changes after the rule is created. For complete accuracy, Administrators should run new or changed rules on the associated entity to ensure all records of the entity reflect the most current evaluation of those rules. For more details, see [Data Quality Rule Evaluation Process](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/data_quality_rules_evaluation_process).

## Stewardship of Data Quality Issues

FastApps Studio and FastApps Portal users can view rules evaluation results in those respective interfaces. For details, refer to the following topics:

## Data Quality Reporting

Data Quality Issues reports can be generated by using the [Power BI integration](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/using_the_power_bi_connector) with Profisee, which can be viewed using the [Report Viewer](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/using_the_report_viewer) in the Profisee Portal.
