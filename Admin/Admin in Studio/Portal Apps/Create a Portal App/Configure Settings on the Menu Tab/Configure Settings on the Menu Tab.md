# Configure Settings on the Menu Tab

The information on the Menu tab of a portal application defines the menu which displays in the portal for the selected application. The default **Home** menu item is linked to default pages and is included with every new application.

Default Notifications pages also exist and can be linked to the menu, but they are not linked by default.

You can edit the names of the default menu items and link them to different pages, if you prefer. You can also [create new menu items](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/add_new_menu_item) and new links to [other portal pages you've created](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/add_a_new_portal_application_page), or to external sites.
