# Portal Applications Overview

The Profisee Portal is installed by default in IIS, under your Profisee application. Portal applications are created in Profisee using the FastApps feature, and are viewed in a browser as sub-sites under the Profisee Portal. Portal applications contain links and views of master data designed to meet specific business needs, providing customized user experiences.

Administrators can build customized applications allowing users to access the data they will work with most frequently via customized menu systems, Web-based entity grids, Profisee reports, and task notifications, all of which apply Profisee permissions to appropriately limit user access.

For more information on creating FastApps, see [Create a New FastApp Application](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_new_fastapp).

Administrators must have the Portal Admin or Super Admin role to create, edit, and delete portal apps.
