# Administer the Profisee FastApps Portal

The Profisee Portal includes elements located in several different areas of Profisee. To control different aspects of the portal, reference the information for the associated feature area, or the specific feature.

## Configuring Workflows

Workflows are built using Visual Studio, published to IIS, and then configured using the Profisee Workflow feature area. For information about workflows, see [Workflow Overview](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/workflow_overview). The configuration process is covered in the topic [Configuring a Workflow](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_workflows).

## Configuring Workflow Notifications

Notifications appear as work items in the Profisee Portal. In addition to configuring a workflow to notify participants, you must configure settings in Profisee Server for notifications to successfully appear. For more information, see [Notifications](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/viewing_notifications).

## Adding FastApps

FastApps portal applications are configured using the FastApps feature area. For more information, see [FastApps Overview](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/portal_applications_overview).

## Configuring FastApps Menus

Portal application menus are components of FastApps portal applications. For more information on customizing portal application menus, see [Configure Settings on the Menu Tab](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_app_admin_menu_tab).

## Configuring Reports

The Analytics area of the Profisee Portal includes numerous options for creating and modifying reports. For specific information on configuring and setting up reports as well as using various Analytics features, refer to the [Configure the Report Viewer Control](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_the_report_viewer_control) article.

## Configuring Email Settings

The Analytics feature includes the ability to email reports and dashboards. The SMTP server settings used to email reports are the same as those used for configuring notifications for workflows.
