# Create A New FastApp

FastApps let administrators create views of data that can be accessed and modified over the Internet using a Web browser by users with appropriate permissions.

Complete the following steps to build a portal application with one or more custom pages:

1. [Configure the Application Context Dialog](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_the_application_context_dialog)

Define the context for the application.
2. [Add a New Application Page](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/add_a_new_portal_application_page)

Create internal pages which allow users to view data and perform work.
3. [Add Portal Controls to the Page](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_fastapps_portal_page_controls)

Add customized controls to the page to allow users to perform many tasks performed in an entity grid through the Web.
4. [Link Controls](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/link_controls) (where applicable)

Certain controls can be linked to other controls. Linking can change the way some controls function (entity grid and filter controls) and is necessary for other controls to function at all (filter controls).
5. [Configure Settings on the Menu Tab](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_app_admin_menu_tab)

Add the new portal application page to the portal menu.

Depending on the controls used and preferences for the way data displays, you may also need to complete the following before creating the new application:

- [Create a New Form](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_new_form)

Build forms to use with controls that present data using forms.
- [Create a New Presentation View](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_new_presentation_view)

Define the attributes users will be able to view in an entity grid control, as well as the filters, sorting options, and other options.
