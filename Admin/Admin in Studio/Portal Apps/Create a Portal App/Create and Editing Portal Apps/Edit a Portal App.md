# Edit a Portal Application

To edit a portal application:

1. In the navigation panel, under Administration, click **FastApps**.
2. Select the application in the list.
3. In the toolbar, click **Edit**.

The portal application edit panel opens.
4. To change context information, click **Edit** next to the current application context.

The name and version are editable; however, the model is established when you create the application. The Model field is read-only after the application is initially configured.
5. On the other application tabs, click **Edit** and make any necessary changes.
