# Configure the Application Context Dialog

1. In the navigation panel, under Administration, click **FastApps**.
2. In the Applications toolbar, click **New**.

The Application Context dialog appears.
3. Enter the following information for the application context:

- **Name**

Enter an application name that:

- Contains no more than 50 characters
- Includes only numbers, letters, and spaces
- Is unique within the list of applications
- **Description**

Enter some text (optional) describing the FastApps Portal application.
4. Click **Save**.

If you are creating a new Portal application, you now have an empty application with a context and a name. The next step is to [configure the settings on the Menu tab](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_app_admin_menu_tab).
