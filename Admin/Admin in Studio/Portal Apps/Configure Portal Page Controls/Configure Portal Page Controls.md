# Configure FastApps Portal Page Controls

Portal page controls allow master data to be presented to users in Web browsers through the portal. Administrators can selectively configure the controls to choose how the data will display, and whether users will be allowed to perform certain actions.

Controls can be added to internal pages created using the FastApps feature area.

The following controls are available to use in portal application pages:

- [Entity Grid](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_the_entity_grid_control)

An entity grid control with customizable attributes and filtering and sorting options, with configurable restrictions for adding and opening members. When an **Open Member form** is included, users with appropriate permissions can open and update displayed members. When an **Add Member form** is included, users can add new members. A **validation issues column** displays the validation status of members. The **View Data Quality Status**, accessed by right-clicking the affected member, displays the rules and conditions causing the selected member to fail validation. Users can correct validation issues for affected members by opening the member. Users only have access to the attributes configured in the form.
- [Filter](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/cofigure_the_filter_control)

A filter control that can be connected to an entity grid control or to another filter control to constrain displayed values.
- [Report Viewer](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_the_report_viewer_control)

A report display control that lets you select reports created in the Analytics area of the portal and display them within a portal application using customized settings in a portal application page.
- [Task List](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configure_the_task_list_control)

A control displaying the current user's open tasks.
