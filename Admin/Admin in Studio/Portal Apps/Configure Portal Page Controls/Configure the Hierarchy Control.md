# Configure the Hierarchy Control

Insert a hierarchy into a Portal page with the Hierarchy Control.

To configure the Hierarchy control:

1. Follow the instructions for [creating a portal application page](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_new_fastapp).
2. Click the plus sign and select Hierarchy from the drop-down menu.
3. Under Properties, enter a name for the control in the Name field.
4. Select the Hierarchy to associate with the control from the drop-down menu.
5. Click Save and Close.

The single-zone page layout is recommended. Putting a hierarchy control on a page with other controls may negatively impact the user experience for portal users.
