# Refresh the Cache

To minimize the number of requests between the Profisee client and the server, Profisee caches certain types of information. Because information may change, there are times when it is necessary to refresh this information. There are two different kinds of cached information and it is refreshed in two different ways:

- Profisee FastApps Studio Data

The cached information which changes the most often is data. When multiple FastApps Studio clients are connected to the same Profisee Server, displayed data may become out of date. To refresh cached data, reconnect the client to the Profisee server. Any user can perform this task without special permissions.
- Portal Cache

The Profisee Portal caches certain data and metadata to ensure optimum performance. To refresh the Portal's cache, click on the Help (?) icon in the Portal page header and select Refresh Portal.
