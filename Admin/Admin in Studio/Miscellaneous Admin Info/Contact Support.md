# Contact Support

If you run into an issue while using Profisee, you can contact Profisee support through the support portal. In addition to creating a support case, you can find information on resolving many common issues and download supplemental product information. The portal may provide you with the tools you need to resolve your issue without creating a case.

To contact Profisee support using FastApps Studio:

1. Click **Help**.
2. Click **Contact Support**.
3. Log in to the Profisee support portal.

Only DSCs (Designated Support Contacts) can use the portal log in. If you have an issue, contact a DSC at your organization for assistance.
