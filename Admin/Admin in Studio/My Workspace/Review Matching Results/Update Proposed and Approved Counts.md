# Update Proposed and Approved Counts

Match counts store the number of proposed and approved source records in each golden record group. As you approve proposed matches, you can update the proposed and approved match counts for all golden records.

1. Open a Matching Results view. For more information, see [Viewing matching results](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_matching_results).
2. Select one of the match options from the **View** menu.

Master records display in the top grid along with the **Approved** and **Proposed Count** columns

3. Click **Update the match counts** on the Matching Results toolbar.

The Approved and Proposed Counts are updated as needed for all golden records in this entity.

- The Proposed and Approved counts are stored in golden record attributes. In strategies where there are no golden records, it is not possible to view the Proposed and Approved counts for match groups.
- The Proposed and Approved counts do not display in golden record attributes when this option is disabled at the strategy level. Updating the counts as shown will cause the counts to display.
