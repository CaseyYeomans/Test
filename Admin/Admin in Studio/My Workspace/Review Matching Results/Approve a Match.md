# Approve a Match

Match group members with scores that fall between the match threshold and the auto-approve threshold are proposed matches (Match Status attribute = 30 {Proposed}). Proposed matches are similar to other members in a match group, but not similar enough to be automatically approved. Therefore, they require manual review.

To approve a proposed match:

1. Open a Matching Results view tab. For more information, see [View matching results](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_matching_results).
2. Select a member in the first grid.

The members in the corresponding match group display in the second grid. If masters were created, the master member is displayed and highlighted as the first member in the list. The Match Status column displays a status of 30 {Proposed} status for the members that require approval.
3. Click the row of a proposed member, or click **Next** to select the next proposed match.
4. To approve a match, do one of the following:

Right-click the member and then click **Approve Match** on the menu.

**--or--**

Click **Approve** on the bottom grid toolbar.

The Match Status for the member changes to 40{Approved}.

Use **Next** and **Previous** to move between Proposed matches. When you reach the last proposed match in a group, clicking **Next** automatically switches the bottom grid to display the match group for the next record in the top grid.

For proposed matches that are not assigned to the correct match group, see the following:
