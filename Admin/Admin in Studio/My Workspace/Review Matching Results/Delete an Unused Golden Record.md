# Delete an Unused Golden Record

When you review matching result with survivorship, it is possible to modify a match group so that is empty except for the golden record. This can occur because all of the group members were moved into other groups, a new group was created from the group members, or the members were unmatched. When this happens, you have the option to keep the unused golden record, or to remove it.

To delete an unused golden record:

1. Select the golden record in the second grid, and then right-click it.
2. Click **Delete Unused Golden Record** on the menu.
3. Click **OK** to confirm that you want to remove the unused golden record.

The unused golden record is deleted.
