# View Additional Attribute Columns

By default, the only attributes that display in the Matching Results tab are Name, Code, strategy matching attributes, and several control attributes (Match Group ID, Match Status, Match Score, and Record Source).

To display additional attribute columns, or hide default columns:

1. From a Matching Results tab, click Columns in the matching results toolbar.
- Attributes that are not currently displayed are listed in the **Available attributes** list.
- Currently displayed attributes appear in the **Selected attributes** list.
2. Move the attributes between the Available attributes and Selected attributes lists by double-clicking, or by using the arrow buttons.
3. Click **Save** to return to the Matching Results tab.

The new columns appear in the view.

When you change the predefined view from the View menu, any columns you have added are retained.
