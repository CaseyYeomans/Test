# Manually Promote Source Data Values

To manually promote a value (update the golden record attribute from a selected source record):

1. Open a Matching Results view tab. For more information, see [Viewing matching results](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_matching_results).
2. Select a row in the top grid to display a match group in the bottom grid.
3. Right-click the cell in the member that you want to copy to the golden record.
4. Select **Promote this Value** on the menu.

The selected attribute value is copied to the golden record.

If a group does not have a golden record, you cannot promote or harmonize values for those group members. Run the survivorship portion of your strategy again to create golden records for any groups that do not have golden records.
