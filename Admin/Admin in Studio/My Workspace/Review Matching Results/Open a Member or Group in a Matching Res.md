# Open a Member or Group in a Matching Results Tab

Opening a member or a group in the Matching Results view opens the selected member or the match group to which the selected member belongs in the Member window. Viewing members or entire groups in the Member window lets you edit single data members as well as entire match groups without leaving the Matching Results view.

To open a member:

1. From any grid in the Matching Results view, right-click the member you want to open.
2. Click **Open Member** on the menu.

The selected member opens in the Member window.
3. Edit or view the data member.
4. When finished with the data member, click **Publish & Close** to save changes and exit, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes and exit.

Although you have edited values for the member, the member is not rescored when you publish it. Therefore, the Match Score remains the same for the member even if matching attribute values are changed.

To open a group:

1. From any grid in the Matching Results view, right-click a member in the group you want to open..
2. Click **Open Group** on the menu.

The members of the match group for the selected member open in the Member window. If the group has a master, it is pinned in the first column.
3. Edit or view the data as needed.
4. When you have finished, click **Publish & Close** to save changes and exit, or click **Cancel** to discard your changes and exit.

Any columns you have added using the **Columns** also display in the Member window.

Editing a match group in the Member window is a quick way to perform survivorship manually on a single group. Use the right-click Copy options in the Member window to quickly copy data values between members.

**Copy to Pinned** is useful for mastering values, while the other options can be used to harmonize values, or copy data between members.

You can:

- **Copy to Others**--Copies the attribute value to the same attribute for the other members.
- **Copy Right**--Copies the attribute value to the same attribute for the members to the right.
- **Copy Left**--Copies the attribute value to the same attribute for the members to the left.
- **Copy to Pinned**--Copies the attribute value to any pinned members (the master is pinned by default).
