# Unmatch Matched Members

If you decide that you do not want a match group to contain one or more members, you can use the Unmatch option to reset the member statuses to an unmatched state.

To unmatch one or more members:

1. From Matching Results, select a group in the first grid.

The group members display in the second grid.
2. Select one or more members to unmatch.
3. Right-click within your selection.
4. Click **Unmatch (Clear Matching Results)** on the menu.
5. Click **OK**to confirm that you want to clear the selected matching results.

The selected members are removed from the match group.

If the match group is empty after the change, you have the option to remove the master.
