# Find Similar Members

When you review matching results, you may find that some members were not matched together as you expected. This often happens because all of the matching attributes did not produce a high enough match score for the members to be a match, even though one or more matching attributes may have matched exactly. Find Similar Members is one method you can use to group these members as you prefer.

Finding similar members lets you locate other possible matches for individual members using a customizable filter. You can filter using any attributes and are not restricted to matching attributes. This is in contrast to View Proposed Matches, which only finds matches for members based on the defined matching strategy. Find Similar Members allows filtering for any valid filter criteria. This is helpful when you need to locate members that might not be included in fuzzy match results.

1. Open a Matching Results view tab. For more information, see [Viewing matching results](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_matching_results).
2. Select a member in the top grid to display the associated match group in the bottom grid.
3. In the bottom grid, select the member that you want to locate other possible matches for.
4. Click **Find similar members** in the bottom grid toolbar.

The Find Similar Members dialog appears.
5. From the list of suggested filters, select as many as are applicable to your search, and then click **Next**.
6. Refine the filter list by adding, editing or removing any filters as you prefer, and then click **Apply**.

The results of the search display a new Matching Results tab.
