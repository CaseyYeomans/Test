# Pin a Match Group

When working with match groups in the Matching Results tab, you can pin a group to lock it in place while searching for other members or match groups. When pinned, the match group moves from the middle to the bottom of the tab.

Pinning makes it possible to keep one group in view while you select different members in the top grid and view their corresponding members in the middle grid. This means that you can keep the pinned group in place while moving members between the pinned group and the middle grid.

Controls used:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | **Pin** |

| | **Move Down** |

To pin a match group:

1. In a Matching Results tab, select a row in the main grid to display a match group in the bottom grid.
2. Click **Pin Group** above the match group grid.

The match group members are pinned to the bottom.

3. Select any record in the top grid to display the associated match group in the middle grid area.

The bottom grid continues to display the pinned group.

You can move members between two match groups using **Move Up** and **Move Down**.
