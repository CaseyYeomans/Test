# Undo and Redo

In the entity grid, Undo reverts unpublished edits in the reverse order in which they were made. Redo lets you reapply actions removed by Undo in sequential order.

- **Undo** an edit by clicking **Undo local changes** on the entity grid toolbar.

--or--

Press **CTRL+Z**.
- **Redo** by clicking to open the menu and then selecting **Redo local changes**.

--or--

Press **CTRL+Y**.

To undo or redo actions in multiple entity view tabs, you must undo actions in each separately.

Redo reapplies undone edits in the order in which they occurred only until the end of undone actions is reached.

Published changes are unaffected by Undo and Redo.
