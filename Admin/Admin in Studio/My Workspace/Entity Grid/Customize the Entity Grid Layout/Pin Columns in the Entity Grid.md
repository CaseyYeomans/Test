Pinned columns stay in view while you scroll to the right to access other columns.

The Name and Code columns are always pinned by default. You can unpin these if you prefer. Unpin and pin columns using the **Pin** icon in each column header, or by right-clicking the column header and selecting **Pin** from the menu.

When a column is pinned, all columns to the left of that column are also pinned. When a column is unpinned, all columns to the right of that column are also unpinned. Pinned columns are retained in saved workspaces. The same columns are pinned in an entity tab when you reopen a saved workspace.
