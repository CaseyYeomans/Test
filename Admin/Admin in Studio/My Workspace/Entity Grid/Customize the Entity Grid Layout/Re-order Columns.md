# Re-order Columns

By default, columns appear in the order in which the attributes were added to the entity. Columns can be reordered so it is easier to focus on specific attributes, place related attributes adjacent to each other, and move less important attributes to less visible positions.

- To move a column, click and hold in the column header and drag it to its new location.

You cannot change the order of pinned columns. Unpin a pinned column first before attempting to move it.

Reordered columns are retained in saved workspaces. When you save a workspace with reordered columns, the columns are in the same order when you reopen the workspace.

Reordered columns are output to Excel. When you save paged grid data as an Excel spreadsheet or open it in Excel, the columns appear in the same order as in the grid.
