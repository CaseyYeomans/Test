# Clone Members

Cloning creates an exact duplicate of one or more members. By default, when not using generated codes, cloned members have the same code as the original member, plus an asterisk prefix. The asterisk makes the cloned member code unique and allows you to immediately publish the new member. However, it is assumed that you will want to change the code to a desired value.

1. Select the data members you want to clone using the row header column. For more information on selecting members, see [Select multiple members](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/selecting_multiple_members).
2. Click Clone selected members in the entity grid toolbar.

The Member window opens, containing duplicates of the selected members.
3. Edit the cloned members as needed.
4. Complete your edits using one of the following actions:

1. - Click **Publish** to save the changes and continue editing.
- Click **Publish & Close** to save the changes and close the window.
- Click **Publish & Add Another** to publish the new members and immediately open a new blank member for editing.
- Click **Cancel** to discard your changes and close the Member window.
