# Export Entity Members to Excel

You can export the data displayed in the entity grid by either saving the data in an Excel file or choosing to open Excel with the exported entity member data.

1. Open an entity view type tab.
2. Click to open the **Open the displayed data in Excel** menu on the entity toolbar, and then click one of the following:
- **Open in Excel** to open Excel with the currently displayed entity member rows.
- **Save as Excel** to save the results as an Excel file. You will be prompted to specify a file name and location.
- **Save Entire Entity** to save all entity data to an Excel spreadsheet.

Unless you choose to save the entire entity, only the paged data is saved in the file. If you are viewing 500 records at a time and there are 2500 members in your entity, then only 500 records are saved. Adjust this setting as needed or apply the appropriate filter criteria to limit the number of rows displayed.

You may need to install data access drivers to import data from Excel, especially when Excel was installed using Office 365. Refer to the Profisee support portal for a workaround.
