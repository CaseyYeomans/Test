# Pin Members in the Member Window

Pinning a member lets you focus on that member while scrolling right to view other members. You can pin members in the Member window in a similar way to pinning attributes in the entity grid.

1. From the entity grid, open two or more members in the Member window. For more information, see [Edit members in the Member window](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/edit_members_in_the_member_window).
2. Click the pin icon in the member column header to pin the member. The unpin icon, colored blue with the pin turned sideways, now displays in the column header.
3. Unpin by clicking the icon in the column header again.

When a member is pinned, all members to the left of that column are also pinned.

When a member is unpinned, all members to the right of that member are also unpinned.

The pin option is only available when more than one member is open in the Member window.
