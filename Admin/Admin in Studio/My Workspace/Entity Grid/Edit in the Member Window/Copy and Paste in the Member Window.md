# Copy and Paste in the Member Window

Edit any attribute value in the Member window as you would in the grid. Note that the view is pivoted in this window--members display as columns, and attributes display as rows. The Member window contains enhanced copy and paste functionality for advanced editing. The following actions are available in the Member window action (**right-click**) menu.

- **Copy** and **Paste**--These actions perform the same actions in the Member window as in the grid. For more information on copy, paste and clear, see [Copy](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/Copy) and [Paste](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/Paste).
- **Clear**--Deletes the selected cell values.
- **Copy to Others**--Copies one or more selected values to all other displayed members.
- **Copy Right**--Copies one or more selected values to members to the right of the selected member.
- **Copy Left**--Copies one or more selected values to members to the left of the selected member.
- **Copy to Pinned**--Copies one or more selected values to the pinned members. Refer to [Pin Columns in the Entity Grid](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/pin_columns_in_the_entity_grid) for details.

The Copy and Paste commands in the Member window only allow values to be copied between the same attribute cells in members. The destination must be within the same row as the source.
