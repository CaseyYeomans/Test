# Filter the Entity Grid by Column

In addition to using the Filter and Sort dialog, you can add filter statements to the entity grid filter using the filter icons at the top of each column.

## Filter Using Grid Column Options

1. Click **Filter** at the top of the column you want to filter.
2. Select the desired values.

If you select Custom, the Filter and Sort dialog opens. For more information, see [Build an Entity Grid Filter](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/build_an_entity_grid_filter).

The grid refreshes and displays the filtered data. The entity grid filter at the top of the tab updates to reflect the additional filter criteria.

## Filter Options

There are several options for filtering entity grid data by column:

- **All**: Clears any previous column filters for the selected column.
- **Custom**: Opens the Filter and Sort dialog.
- **Blanks**: Displays those members without values for the filtered column.
- **NonBlanks**: Displays those members that contain values for the filtered column.
- **Value**: Displays a list of values (for domain-based attributes only). Select one or more of the listed values, and all members containing the selected attribute values display.
