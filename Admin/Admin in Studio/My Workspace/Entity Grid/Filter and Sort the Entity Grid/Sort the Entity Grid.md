# Sort the Entity Grid

Sort data numerically or alphabetically by clicking column headers or using the Sort Order tab in the Filter and Sort dialog.

## Sort by Column

1. In the entity grid, click the column header of the column you want to sort.

A triangle displays in the column heading.
2. Click the triangle until it points in the correct direction (downward for descending; upward for ascending).

The grid refreshes and sorts the members according to your selection.

Use SHIFT+click and CTRL+click to sort the grid using multiple columns.

## Sort Using Filter and Sort Options

The Filter and Sort dialog is used to make multiple edits to the filter and sort criteria before applying changes to the grid and refreshing the data.

To change the current sort of the entity grid:

1. Above the entity grid, click **Filter**.

The Filter and Sort dialog appears.
2. Click the **Sort Order** tab.

The default sort order displays in the tab: Attribute = Code, Direction = Ascending.
3. Click the down arrow for the **Attribute** list to open the list of entity attributes.
4. From the list, select an attribute to sort the entity on.
5. Click the down arrow for the **Direction** list to open list of sort directions.
6. Select **Ascending** or **Descending** as the sort direction.
7. Add multiple sorting attributes by clicking **Add**, and then selecting additional attributes and sort directions.

Sorting on additional attributes causes the grid to sort on values within the primary sort.
8. Change the order of sort attributes by selecting the row and using the up arrow to move sort criteria up, or the down arrow to move sort criteria down.
9. Click **Save**.

The grid is now sorted with your sort selections. Hovering over the Filter icon displays the columns and sort directions currently used to sort the grid.
