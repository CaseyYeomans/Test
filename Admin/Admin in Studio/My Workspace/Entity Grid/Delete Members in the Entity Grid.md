# Delete Members in the Entity Grid

To delete members from the entity grid:

1. In the entity grid, select the member or members you want to delete using the row header column. For more information, see [Select Multiple Members](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/selecting_multiple_members).
2. Click Delete selected members on the entity grid toolbar.

**--or--**

Right-click inside one of the selected member rows, and then select **Delete Members** on the menu.

3. Confirm the deletion.

In deferred publishing mode, the row backgrounds for deleted members appear red in the grid. Deleted members are later removed from the entity when the data is published.

In live publishing mode, deleted members are immediately removed from the entity grid after you confirm the deletion.
