# Open a Saved Workspace

Opening a saved workspace file reloads the layout options you saved in a previous Profisee session. Your grid layout, grid display options, tabs, and open entities load in your current workspace. Workspace files let you continue with the same layout options you used in your previous session.

To open a saved workspace file:

1. Click the Folder icon labeled **Open a workspace** on the main toolbar.
2. Navigate to the saved workspace file and select it.
3. Click **Open**.
4. Choose to save or discard the current workspace settings.

Your current workspace closes and the selected workspace opens.
