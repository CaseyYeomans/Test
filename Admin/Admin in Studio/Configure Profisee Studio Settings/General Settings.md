# General Settings

To access the Profisee Desktop settings:

1. Click **Settings** on the right side of the toolbar.
2. Click **Desktop Settings**.

The My Profisee Desktop Settings dialog appears.

3. The following settings are available in the General Settings tab of Desktop Settings.

| Option | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Always save workspace on exit and load on startup** | Save workspace configuration changes on exit and resume with the same workspace when you next start the Desktop. |
| **Code Name Separator** | Select the symbols that separate the data member names and codes in a member label. |
| **Maximum column auto-size width** | Sets the maximum width for column auto-sizing as a safety for unusually long attribute (column) values. You can increase the width of any column beyond this size manually. |

Selecting to save your workspace automatically means your open workspace tabs, grid filters and display options are retained whenever you exit Profisee.
