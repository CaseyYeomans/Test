## Always Check for Changes to Value Lists For DBA Value

If values are added frequently in your Profisee environment, select **Always check for changes**.

If new values are found, it retrieves those values and updates the list. This setting is useful if you anticipate continual updates to lists of domain values and want to make sure you are using the most current lists possible.
