| Maximum number of cores | Controls the number of client cores used during the archiving process. Increasing the number of cores improves performance by multithreading. Do not set at or above the number of available cores (threads) on your computer. |

This setting applies to all data archiving strategies initiated on the client from Profisee Desktop. It does not apply to strategies executed using the Command Line Utility.
