# Close Form Script Action

The Close Form script action closes a form when the user clicks the button.

It can be helpful to include the Close Form script action at the end of a complex button script to prevent users from performing duplicate actions and otherwise prevent confusion resulting when a form remains open after it is used to perform data changes.

To add the Close Form script action to a button:

1. From the list of actions, select **Close Form**, and then click **Add**.
2. Click **OK**.

There are no action properties available with the Close Form script action.

Do not include additional script actions after Close Form.
