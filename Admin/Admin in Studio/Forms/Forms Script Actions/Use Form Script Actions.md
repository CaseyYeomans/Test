# Use Form Script Actions

A script action defines the events that occur when a button in a form is clicked. The script action be associated with a button control, which runs when a user clicks the button, or it can run as a pre- or post-action for a context button (Approve, Reject, Save, or Save and Close). Pre-actions are processed before the action for the context button is processed, and post-actions are processed after the context button action is processed. The actions configured for the button affect the member selected in the form at the time the user clicks the button.

Refer to the linked help topic for each script action for more information.
