# View Form Properties

Forms properties lets you view the context of the form and access the context buttons.

To view form properties:

- Navigate to **Administration | Forms**.
- Select a form in the list.
- Click **Edit** in the Forms toolbar.

The Forms edit panel opens.
- Click **Properties**.

The Form Properties dialog appears.
- On the General tab, you can view the following information:

- **Name**
A unique name identifying the form in the Forms list.
- **Entity**
The entity you want to use with the form.
*Note: When creating a form for a specific workflow, select the entity used in the workflow.*
- **Form Title**
The text to display at the top of the form when you preview it or view it rendered in HTML.
- **Description**
Text to describe the form. This information is optional.
- **Render form with tabs visible**
Selecting this option displays all tabs in the form when the participant views the task. All tabs in the form display and can be clicked. Users can move from tab to tab. Clearing this option causes only the first tab to display. Other tabs are inaccessible unless there are buttons in the form with script actions that open the tabs.
- **Use this form as the default for the entity**
Selecting this option causes this form to be displayed as the default form in the Relationship Manager. This value cannot be unchecked from the current default form; it must be set from a form that is not the current default form. When a form is made the default form, the existing default form is also updated to indicate that it is no longer the default form.

- On the Context Buttons tab, you can configure the default buttons that appear on forms.
