# Copying Forms

To copy a form:

1. Navigate to **Administration | Forms**.
2. Select the form in the list.
3. Click **Copy** in the Forms toolbar.

The Forms Properties dialog appears.

The copied form includes the same properties as the original (except for name, which is the same but with "copy" appended to it).
4. Configure the properties for the form:

- **Name**

A unique name identifying the form in the Forms list.
- **Entity**

The entity you want to use with the form.

Note: When creating a form for a specific workflow, select the entity used in the workflow.
- **Form Title**

The text to display at the top of the form when you preview it or view it rendered in HTML.
- **Description**

Text to describe the form. This information is optional.
- **Render forms with tabs visible**

Selecting this option displays all tabs in the form when the participant views the task. All tabs in the form display and can be clicked. Users can move from tab to tab. Clearing this option causes only the first tab to display. Other tabs are inaccessible unless there are buttons in the form with script actions that open the tabs.
- **Allow viewing member history**

Selecting this option allows Data Stewards using this form to review data change details of a member, including a history of what was changed, when, and by whom.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Make changes, if any, to the form layout.
7. When you have finished making your changes, click **Save and Close**.
