# Create a New Form

To create a new form:

1. Navigate to **Administration | Forms**.
2. On the Forms toolbar, click **New**.
3. In the **Name** field, type a name to help you identify the form.
4. Click the **Entity** list and then select the entity you want to use with the form.

When building a form to use with a specific workflow, you must select the same entity used in the workflow.
5. In the **Form Title** field, type the text to display as the title when you preview the form or view it rendered in HTML.
6. In the **Description** field, enter any descriptive text you want to include. The Description is optional.
7. Choose to select or clear the **Render forms with tabs visible** option.

Selecting this option displays all tabs in the form when the participant views the task. All tabs in the form display and can be clicked. Users can move from tab to tab. Clearing this option causes only the first tab to display. Other tabs are inaccessible unless there are buttons in the form with script actions that open the tabs.
8. Click **Save**.

The Forms edit panel opens.
9. In the Tab Name field, type a name for the first tab in the form, and then click **OK**.

You can add multiple tabs containing different form controls in a single form.

The form Layout panel appears on the left, and the form Display panel appears on the right.
10. With **Layout** selected, right-click anywhere inside the Layout panel to begin adding controls to your form.

Select any of the controls from the menu that displays to add to the layout:
