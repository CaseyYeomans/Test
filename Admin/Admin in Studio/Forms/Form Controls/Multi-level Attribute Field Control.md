# Multi-level Attribute Field Control

A Multi-level Attribute (MLA) field displays the value for a selected MLA in an entity. This control allows you to navigate through parent-child relationships to select a Multi-level Attribute to use in your form.

To configure the Multi-level Attribute field control, select it in the Layout panel and edit the options in the Display panel.

Unlike normal attributes, you cannot create cascading fields on a form using a Multi-level Attribute.
