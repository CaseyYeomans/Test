# Button Panel Control

The Button Panel organizes buttons as a group. It serves as a container for buttons and provides additional layout options. Buttons added without a Button Panel are stacked vertically in the form. Adding a Button Panel allows you to organize them horizontally in a row.

Add a Button to a Button Panel control by right-clicking the Button Panel control and then clicking Add button on the menu.
