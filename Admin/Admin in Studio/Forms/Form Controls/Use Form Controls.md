# Use Form Controls

Form controls allow administrators to add interactivity to workflows. By default, forms include the necessary buttons for participants to approve, reject, or contribute to a workflow. Additional form controls add additional display and interactivity options. For example, adding field controls to a form can allow the participants to view the particular attribute values for a given member that they are approving. Adding button controls along with fields can allow users to make changes to attribute values and submit them. Labels can clarify the purpose of controls included in forms.

Some controls can be added to other controls to allow more layout possibilities. Buttons can be grouped within button panels, and layout grids can include columns that can contain any other controls. Button controls include configurable script actions, allowing the construction of more complex interactions. Refer to the linked topic for each control for more information.
