# Sort System Settings

System Settings support sorting by category and alphabetically to make it easier to locate settings.

Sorting alphabetically:

1. Click **Settings** in the main toolbar.
2. Click **System Settings** in the menu.

The Systems Settings dialog appears. By default, the settings are sorted by category.
3. Click **Alphabetical**.

Settings are sorted alphabetically. Settings that are located within a subcategory are sorted alphabetically within that subcategory.

After sorting the settings alphabetically, click **Categorized** to return to the default sort order.
