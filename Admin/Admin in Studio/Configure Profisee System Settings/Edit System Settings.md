# Edit System Settings

The System Settings option appears on the Profisee Settings menu for users with permission to the Profisee System Administration functional area. Users without this permission do not see the System Settings menu option and cannot edit server settings.

Guidance text is provided at the bottom of the screen with information on each setting as it is selected. More detailed information on individual settings is included in procedures using those settings.

You must be connected to a Profisee Server to edit system settings.

To edit settings:

1. Click **Settings** in the main toolbar.
2. Click **System Settings** in the menu.

The Systems Settings dialog appears.
3. Locate the setting that you want to change. You can sort or expand and collapse settings to find a particular setting more easily.
4. Change the setting as needed.

Setting values in the System Settings dialog that differ from the current setting values for the server appear in bold.

If a value exceeds the maximum value for a setting, the setting updates to the maximum allowed value.

If an entered value is too short for a setting requiring a text value of a minimum length, a warning message displays.

5. Click **Save**.

Clicking **Save** updates the settings on Profisee Server. It is only necessary to click **Refresh** when multiple users are editing System Settings at the same time, and there is a possibility that the locally cached settings are out of date.
