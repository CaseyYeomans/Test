# Copy a Presentation View

Once you have created a presentation view, you can easily create a copy of it and all of its contents.

1. Navigate to **Presentation Views** under the Administration panel to open the Presentation Views tab.
2. In the Presentation Views tab, select the presentation view you want to copy.
3. Click **Copy** in the Presentation Views toolbar.

A copy is created with the default name "[Presentation View Name] Copy." You can change the name of the copy by [using the Edit tool](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/edit_a_presentation_view).
