# SQL Server Deployment Overview

Before a Profisee administrator can use the SQL Server or OneLake service providers in Connect, you must configure a SQL Server database to be compatible with Connect. The specifics of your configuration may vary based on the needs of your organization and whether your Profisee instance is installed on-premise or as a SaaS instance. However, the following steps and guidelines should be taken to ensure a successful integration between SQL/OneLake and Profisee Connect.
