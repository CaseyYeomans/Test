# Managing Connections

Profisee users with Super Administrator privileges can create and manage connections as an administrator within Profisee Portal. **Connect** allows you to integrate MDM entities with external resources to perform additional data management activities, either through an officially supported connector, or by creating your own custom connector through a generic REST endpoint. For example; by using the supported *MelissaData Personator* connector, you can manage Address Verification through the Profisee Portal by using Connect.

To manage connections in Profisee Portal, navigate to the **Administration** tab in Profisee portal to open the Administration workspace. ![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i4426cf02818fd17f.png)

From here, click the **Connect** tab on the left-hand sidebar. Here, you can create, configure, and run **Service Providers**, **Service Configurations**, and **Strategies**.

- **Service Providers** allow you to determine the provider for your Profisee connections. As of 2024.R1, the only available pre-configured service provider is Melissa Data. Custom Service Providers can also be used.
- **Service Configurations** allow you to set up vital information for your service provider (such as service type, location, and credentials) to enable integration.
- **Strategies** allow you to create rules and behaviors to control the integration process.
