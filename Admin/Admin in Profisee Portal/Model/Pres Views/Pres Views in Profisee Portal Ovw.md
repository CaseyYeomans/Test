# Presentation Views in Profisee Portal Overview

**Presentation views** are reusable entity grid configurations for use with portal page controls in FastApps. They include multiple display options, including attribute columns, filtering and sorting information, display format, page size, and optional information such as the display format of DBAs, the default page size, and whether the validation column displays.

Profisee Portal users with Super Administrator or Portal Administrator privileges can perform Presentation View functions in the Profisee Portal without needing to use the Profisee FastApp Studio interface. Using the **Presentation View** tab in the **Model** heading in the portal, you can create, edit, import and export, and manage presentation views to be used in Profisee.
