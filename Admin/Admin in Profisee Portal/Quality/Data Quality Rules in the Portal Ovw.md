# Data Quality Rules in the Portal Overview

Profisee Administrators can create, run, and manage Data Quality Rules in the Profisee Portal. Data Quality Rules give you the ability to specify characteristics of what defines good data quality. You can use data quality rules to evaluate golden record data and flag attribute values in golden records as either passing or failing.

To manage Data Quality Rules, navigate to the Administration section of the portal and select the **Quality** tab from the administration sidebar. ![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-ib61f3e8edefc792f.png)

From here, the Data Quality Rules grid displays all currently existing rules as well as basic information pertaining to those rules based on their configuration. This view may also display a warning icon to indicate a potential error with the data quality rule. You can hover over this icon for a basic description of the violation, or click the icon for additional details.
