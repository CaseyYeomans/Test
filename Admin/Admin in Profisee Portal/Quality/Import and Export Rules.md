# Importing and Exporting Rules

Profisee Administrators can easily import or export a set of rules for use in Profisee, making it easy to transfer rules from a test environment into a production environment, or to transfer rules between different instances of Profisee. To do so, navigate to the **Quality** section of the Administration view in Profisee Portal and select the **vertical ellipsis** icon in the Data Quality Rules toolbar. ![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i8466d2b1eebb102b.png)

Select **Export (All)** to export all rules as a file, **Export (Selected)** while selecting specific rules to export just those rules, or **Import** to upload a ruleset into your Profisee instance.

Note that the *.rules* files used by FastApp Studio rules and the *.json*files used by Profisee Portal rules are not interchangable. Rules from Profisee Portal cannot be imported into FastApp Studio rules, and FastApp Studio rules cannot be imported into Profisee Portal.
