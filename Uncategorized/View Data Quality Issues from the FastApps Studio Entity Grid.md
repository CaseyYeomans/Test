# View Data Quality Issues from the FastApps Studio Entity Grid

View the data quality status of the members using the FastApps Studio Entity Grid. The first column in the grid displays the member's data quality status. The following values are possible:

- A green check mark indicates the member has passed validation or the entity has no rules defined.
- A red exclamation point indicates that the member has failed validation and there may be one or more issues associated with that member.
- A yellow question mark indicates that the member has been added or changed but not yet published to the server and therefore the member's current data quality status is unknown.

To see the full details of a member's data quality status you can either:

1. Right-click on a member and click the **View Details** item in the context menu.

**--or--**
2. Click on the data quality status icon in the first column of the entity grid for the member of interest.

The Member Details panel opens. The **Data Quality** pane displays the data quality status for any attribute with an associated data quality rule. For details, see [View Data Quality Issues from the Member Details Panel](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_data_quality_issues_from_the_member_details_panel).

You can fix data quality issues directly from the entity grid by entering the corrected information into the respective grid cells. Alternatively, you can see and correct the issues by opening the affected member or members in the Member window. For details, see [View Data Quality Issues from the Member Window](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_data_quality_issues_from_the_member_window).
