# View Data Quality Issues from the Member Window

In the Member window, column headers highlighted in red indicate members with data quality issues. Any member (column) can contain multiple issues. A data quality issue icon displays in the cell of each attribute that fails validation. Edit the values to satisfy the requirements of rules in the Member window.
