# Open and Edit a Hierarchy Record Using a Form

You can open a record and edit record data directly from a form when working with a hierarchy on a page. To do this:

1. Expand the hierarchy view until the desired record is displayed.
2. Right-click the record and select Open from the drop-down menu.

When you open a record from the hierarchy and that record has a hierarchy field, the hierarchy control is disabled to prevent creating a circular loop.

4. Click **Save** to save changes and keep the form open for further editing.
5. Click **Save & Close** to complete editing, close the form, and return to the hierarchy view.
