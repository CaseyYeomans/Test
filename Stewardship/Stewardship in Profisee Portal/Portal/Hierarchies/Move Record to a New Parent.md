# Move Record to a New Parent

Users can reorder records within a hierarchy and move records to a different parent by using Move tools in the hierarchy view. There are two primary ways to move records around in a hierarchy; Move Mode, and Click and Drag.

**Move Mode** allows you to select one or more records, view valid parents those records can be moved to, and order them under a new parent.

You can also manually **click and drag** records to re-organize them under their existing parent. You can **not** click and drag a record to a new parent. You can only move a record to a new parent by using Move Mode.

To enter Move Mode:

1. Right-click a record (or shift + click multiple records to select multiple), then click **Move**. A "Choose Move Destination" panel opens on the left, and a "Move Instructions" panel opens on the right.

2. Hover over any of the displayed destinations that show an arrow icon, then click the checkmark icon to move the object(s) there. Alternatively, right-click the destination and select "Move Here."
