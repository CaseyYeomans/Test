# Remove a Child Record From a Hierarchy

Using the hierarchy control, you can view records in their hierarchical context and remove a record from its parent. Be aware that you are not deleting the record from its entity. You are only removing the Relationship that defines the record as a child of a particular parent.

To remove a child record from a hierarchy:

1. Right-click the record you want to remove.
2. Select **Remove** from the drop-down menu.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i232f6150d62a98d9.png)

The record is removed from the hierarchy.
