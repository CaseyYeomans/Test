# View and Navigate a Hierarchy

You can easily view and navigate all levels of a hierarchy from a FastApps Portal page with a few mouse clicks. Once a hierarchy has been [configured by a system administrator](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/hierarchies_overview) (and you have permission to access it), it will appear in the [sidebar](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/toolbar_and_sidebar) of Profisee portal. The hierarchy is represented as a series of nested, collapsible lists that can be expanded to view records. You may change the horizontal size of this list by clicking and dragging from the edge of the zone.

There are 3 key elements in the hierarchy tree:

1. The subject

2. The ancestry breadcrumb

3. The children of the subject

Clicking an item will expand the list if there are more branches beneath it, and it will open a form with the selected record if it is a root-level item in the list. The list hierarchy list stays open, but branches can be collapsed by clicking their icons again.

Once a root-level item has been selected, you can use the opened form to view, add, edit, or remove records, depending on how the hierarchy is configured.

Whether or not the tree is collapsed, you can navigate your currently selected branch using the breadcrumbs on the top left of the list. Clicking the arrow to the right of the breadcrumb bubble opens a dropdown list containing each level within the branch. Selecting any of the displayed items will open the tree to that level.

Alternatively, clicking the breadcrumb bubble directly will immediately take you back to the last level in the branch.
