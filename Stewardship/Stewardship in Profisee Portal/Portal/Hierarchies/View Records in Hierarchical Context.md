# View Records in Hierarchical Context

The Hierarchy icon in a record form provides a quick way to view the record's position in a hierarchy. This is useful when working with record data in an entity grid, where hierarchical relationships are not immediately obvious.

If configured with a Relationship form, you can view records in the context of a hierarchy in FastApps Portal:

1. Click the desired record to open the record form.
2. Click the **Hierarchy** icon.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i2c2c9cdb44364e91.png)

The view changes to display the record and any parent or child attributes associated with that record.
