# Managing Task Assignments

You can use the task assignment tab to view and manage task assignments within Profisee FastApps portal. The task assignment tab allows a user that is assigned to that task to view the active assignment, as well as edit or remove the assignees for each active task.

To access the assignment tab:

1. Open the work page containing the task you want to manage.
2. Open the task you want to manage.
3. Click the **View Task Assignments** tab on the far right of the window.

### Viewing Task Assignments

After navigating to the task assignment tab, you can view all of the participants and their status for the affiliated task. The following information is displayed within this window:

- **Name**: Shows the display name of the task participant. If no display name is available, the participant's account name is shown instead.
- **Status**: Shows whether the participant is Active, Complete, or Canceled.
- **Assigned**: Shows the date and time the task was assigned to that user.
- **Date**: Shows the last date and time an update was made to this task, either by the workflow administrator or a task participant.
- **Assigned By**: Shows the account or process that assigned the user to this task.

You can sort the display order of the task assignments by clicking the header of any column in the list.

### Adding and Canceling Task Assignments

Using the task assignment tab, a user can manage the users assigned to the selected task by adding and canceling users from the task list.

To add a user to the task:

1. Click the **Assign to** search bar at the top of the window.
2. Type the first characters of the display name of the user or team you wish to add, then click that user or team.
3. Click **OK** to add the user or team to the task.

- You cannot assign users or teams in batches.
- If you add a team to the assignment, all individual users in that team will be added to the assignment.

To cancel a user in the assignment list, hover over the row containing their display name and click the red **X** icon to the left of their name. You can cancel users in bulk by selecting multiple rows before clicking the **X** icon on any selected user's row. Canceled users will not be removed from the display, but they will not be able to view the task list unless their status returns to Active.

Note that you cannot cancel:

- All users in the assignment list
- Your own account
- Users that have already completed their task
- Users in a task that has already closed
