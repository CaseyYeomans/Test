# Using Aisey AI Assistant

Profisee's AI Assistant **Aisey** is a powerful tool that can be used to automatically perform modeling and stewardship tasks in the Portal, quickly navigate through an instance, or gain insight into Profisee MDM using only the Profisee AI Chatbot. This feature is available for Profisee users with configured [OpenAI Integration](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/open_AI) and a Profisee AI License.

To access the Profisee Aisey, navigate to the Profisee Portal and find the AI Icon***i**n the toolbar next to your profile. ![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i8d0e27bcb0d9bcfa.png)

From here, the Profisee AI Chatbox appears, allowing you to make plain-text prompts to perform tasks in Profisee Portal. Below are some common actions the Chatbot can take.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-iaed6ee63560ee6ae.jpeg)

### Navigating to Entity Grids Directly with Aisey

You can directly navigate to a specific entity grid in the Portal by asking Aisey to take you there. Open the Chatbot and enter a prompt like, "Take me to the entity grid for the Customer entity." Aisey will automatically navigate to that page from anywhere in the portal.

### Creating Entities and Attributes with Aisey

You can use Aisey to instantly create an entity without needing to use the entity creation UI. Open the Chatbot and enter a prompt like "Create an entity named Mountain Bike with the attributes Size and Cost." Allow Aisey a moment to complete the process. If there are multiple items created (such as one entity with two attributes) you must accept a confirmation for each. Afterwards, Aisey will ask if you wish to navigate to the newly created entity when finished.

### Access Information about Existing Entities and Attributes

You can gain insights into your data by asking Aisey questions about records and attributes in your entity. Open Aisey and enter a prompt like "How many records with 'Bike' in the name exist under the 'Mountain Bikes' entity?' Aisey will provide an answer and will then ask if you want to modify the information in the returned records.

### Filtering Records with Aisey

You can use Aisey to filter records in Profisee Portal, allowing you to quickly use plain text to retrieve a list of records in an entity. Open Aisey anywhere in the portal (either from the toolbar or via the Suggest button on the Filter/Sort dialogue) and enter a prompt like "Only show me Mountain Bikes that are red and cost less than $500." Aisey opens and creates a filter expression for you within the Filter/Sort Dialogue on the appropriate entity, following your instructions as closely as possible. If desired, you can manually edit the generated filter expression before clicking Continue.

### Learning with Aisey

You can use Aisey to search through the Help documentation on the Profisee Support site, gaining insights into how to perform specific actions within the portal. For instance, you could enter a prompt like, "How do I access the report viewer?" to receive detailed instructions on how to navigate and use the report viewer.
