# Viewing the Portal in Compact View

When using Profisee Portal, you can view more data at a time by browsing the portal in **Compact View**. This optional view compresses the elements on the page, allowing for a broader view of your data.

To access Compact View:

1. Click the **Settings** icon in the top-right corner of the portal.
2. Select Compact View from the dropdown list.
3. If desired, select Open View to return to the default portal view.

Once a view is selected, your browser will retain that selection until it is changed again.
