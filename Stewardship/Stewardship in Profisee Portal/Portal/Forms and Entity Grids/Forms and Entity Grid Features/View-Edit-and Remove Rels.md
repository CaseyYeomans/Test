# View, Edit, and Remove Relationships

You can manage the properties of a relationship from the Relationship List on a form in Profisee FastApp Portal. If the relationship is a Many to Many Relationship, the properties of the relationship that are defined by the bridge entity can be viewed and edited to specify information about the relationship. For more information about bridge properties, see [Creating a Many-to-Many Relationship](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_many-to-many_relationship).

Additionally, included records can be removed from the Relationship List entirely from this view.

Note that when removing a record from a Relationship List, that record is deleted entirely.
