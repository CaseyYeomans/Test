# Establishing New Many-to-Many Relationships

A user can add Many-to-Many relationships records on a form that is configured to display a Relationship List. This feature allows a user to include several records in batch to a relationship list and set the relationship properties for those records.

1. Click the **+** button on the top-right of the relationship list to open the Bulk Add form.
2. Locate the records you want to add to the relationship and pin them to the list by clicking the thumbtack icon.

To easily locate the desired records, use the quick filter at the top of the form to search for records within the list. Records with attributes matching the entered text are automatically filtered into the list. For more information, see [Use the Quick Filter](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/use_the_quick_filter).

3. If this relationship is configured to set additional properties, click**Next**to continue to the relationship property configuration. Otherwise, click **Save** to add the selected records to the relationship.
4. Optionally specify the relationship properties that define certain attributes of this relationship. These properties are configured by a system administrator.
5. Click **Save** to add the records to the relationship.
