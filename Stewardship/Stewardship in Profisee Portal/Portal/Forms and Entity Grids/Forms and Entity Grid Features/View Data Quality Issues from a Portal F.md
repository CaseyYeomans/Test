# View Data Quality Issues from a FastApps Portal Form

When you are working with an entity using a Portal form, you can see the data quality issues associated with the fields presented on the form. Data quality issues are highlighted by the presence of one of the following icons to the left of the input field on the form:

- The red warning icon indicates that the field has a data quality issue and that you will be prohibited from saving and closing or saving and continuing until this issue is resolved. For details on requiring validation to proceed, refer to the [Field Control](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/field_control) topic in Forms.
- The yellow warning icon indicates that the field has a data quality issue. However, in this case you can save and close or save and continue without correcting the issue.

| --- | --- |
| | **Red warning icon** |
| | **Yellow warning icon** |

In both cases above, you can hover your mouse pointer over the icon and the text of the data quality issue is displayed as illustrated below. The description for the data quality rule is determined by the optional **Display Description** property in Profisee FastApp Studio.
