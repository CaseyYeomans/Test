# Cloning Records

Portal users can duplicate records in a form by using the **Clone** feature to make either an identical copy of an existing record, or a modified copy of an existing record. The Clone feature can be accessed anywhere in the portal where a user has permissions to create a new record. Note that users that cannot create new records cannot Clone existing records. Records with pending changes must be saved before they can be cloned.

To Clone a record in a form:

1. Navigate to a form in the portal.
2. Open the record you want to clone by double-clicking the record or by right-clicking the record and selecting **Open**.
3. Click the vertical ellipsis icon in the top-right corner of the record details window.![Image](https://profisee.visualstudio.com/ad098ab8-fc30-4fe4-982d-460e6c9eb694/_apis/wit/attachments/2265e874-855a-4def-8c92-524c1640faf9?fileName=image.png)

Note that cloned records must be given a new Code value, as all records must have unique Codes.

If an administrator has enabled the **Clear on Clone**option on an attribute, the value of that attribute will not be cloned.

5. Click **Save** or **Save and Close** to finalize the new record. If desired, you can edit the values of any attributes of the cloned record to create a new distinct record.
