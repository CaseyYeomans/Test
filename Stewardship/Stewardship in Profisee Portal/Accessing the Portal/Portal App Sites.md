# Portal Application Sites

Portal application sites are available to all users with appropriate permissions. These sites can be accessed by clicking an icon on the Profisee Portal Landing Page or App Tray, or by accessing the direct URL for the site in the following location:

http://ProfiseeServerName/ProfiseeVirtualDirectory/applicationSiteName

Portal application sites are the main location for all of your data in Profisee Portal. Application sites are created by your administrator and include access to entities you have loaded into the Profisee model, filtering and report generation tools, forms, relationships, and presentation views as configured by the administrator.

For more information on working in a Portal Application Site, refer to the **Using the Portal** section of the wiki for individual features and uses in the Portal.
