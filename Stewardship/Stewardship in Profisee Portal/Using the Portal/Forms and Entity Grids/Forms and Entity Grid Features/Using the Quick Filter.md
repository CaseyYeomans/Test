# Using the Quick Filter

The Quick Filter allows a user to search for records within an entity grid, relationship list grid, or DBA dialog using keywords related to those records. The Quick Filter is located in the zone header of an entity grid, the top of the control section of a relationship list, or in a DBA dialog that has been [configured to use the Quick Filter](http://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/create_a_new_presentation_view).![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i6bcbc9b19cfad885.png)

To use the Quick Filter, click the box containing the text **Enter filter keyword**,enter the text you want to filter on, and either press the Enter key or click the submit icon. Records containing attributes that begin with the entered keywords are returned.

If the Quick Filter is not operating as expected, it may not be configured to filter keywords on all attributes. By default, the Quick Filter only filters on Name and Code attributes containing the filter keywords. An administrator can configure a Quick Filter to search on any text, link, or DBA attribute.

Additionally, if an expected result is not being returned, the user attempting the filter may not have access to view one or more of the attributes in the Quick Filter. If a user does not have access to view any attributes that have been configured for the Quick Filter, the Quick Filter is not displayed to that user.
