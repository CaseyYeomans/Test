# Downloading an Entity Grid as an Excel File

A user in Profisee FastApp Portal can export an entity grid as a .XLSX file to be used in Microsoft Excel. Doing so creates a spreadsheet that resembles the data contained within the entity grid. The columns in the .XLSX spreadsheet are determined by the presentation view of the entity grid; however, the **Code** entity will always be included as the first column of the spreadsheet.

1. Click the **Download to Excel** icon within an entity grid zone header.

The Download to Excel icon is disabled if the entity grid contains more that 1,048,575 records. A data steward can apply a filter to reduce the number of displayed records in order to export large entity grids.
