# Viewing Notifications

When you are assigned a workflow task, or if a workflow designer configures a workflow to send a notification to users, you will receive a notification in the FastApps Portal and optionally through email. Depending on [how the workflow is configured](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/configuring_send_notification_activities), you may receive the notification immediately or at periodic intervals specified in [System Settings](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/system_settings_notification).

To view and manage your notifications, hover over the bell icon on the System Menu and perform one of the following actions:

- Click the **Notifications** header title on the dropdown list to view the bell icon and navigate to the Notifications page. All notifications on this page are listed in reverse chronological order.
- Click a Notification entry in the dropdown list to navigate directly to the Task List for all Approval and Contribution tasks.

The Notifications Page in the Portal lists your most recent Notifications in reverse chronological order. For task notifications, you can click a Notification entry to be taken to the Task List with the Form opened on the record associated with the assigned task.
