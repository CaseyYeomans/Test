# Viewing Tasks

When a task is assigned to a user, that task appears in the user's task list. A user can click any of the tasks available in their task list to make the required contributions or approvals, or to [view and manage](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/manage_task_assignments) the users assigned to that task.

To view your task list, click the **Task List** icon in the left-hand sidebar of the Profisee FastApps Portal.
