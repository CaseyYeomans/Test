# Tasks and Workflows Overview

A workflow is a long-running process composed of activities, many of which are automated by the Profisee platform. However, some of these activities include **tasks**, which require a data steward to manually review, add, or alter a piece of data.

There are two types of tasks a data steward can be assigned in FastApp Portal: **Contribution Tasks** and **Approval Tasks**.

- [Contribution Tasks](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/contribution_task) allow assignees to change values of a record and advance the workflow to the next task in the workflow if one exists. A Contribution Task is used to add or change data of the member associated with the task. A contributor can change values in the Contribution Task Form to which they are granted update rights.
- [Approval Tasks](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/approval_task) gives an assignee the ability to approve or reject data changes made by other users or processes. An approver can also change values in the Approval Task Form to which they are granted update rights.

When a user is assigned a task, the new assignment will appear in their [notifications](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/viewing_notifications) feed. A user can also view their total queue of assignments using the [Task List](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/viewing_tasks). If necessary, a user can also use the [task assignment tab](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/manage_task_assignments) to manage their tasks assignments in a more detailed view. Users must have Read and Update permissions to complete task assignments.
