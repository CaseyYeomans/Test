# Create and Edit Entities from the Data Browser

Profisee users with Administrator privileges can create new entities directly in Profisee Portal via the Data Browser. These entities persist into Profisee FastApp Studio and operate identically to traditionally-created entities.

To create an entity in the Profisee Portal:

1. Click into the Data Browser field labeled *Find your data*and click the *Create New* selection. The **Create Entity** field appears.
2. Enter a Name for the new entity.
3. Optionally enter a Description and an Icon (from FontAwesome) to be displayed with the entity.
4. Optionally, select the **Create Code values automatically** option to automatically create code values for records in this entity.
5. Optionally, include a File Attachment by clicking the + icon under **File Attachments**and including the Type and Allowed File extensions. For more information, see [File Attachments](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/add_a_file_attachment).
6. Optionally, select a Data Product to include this entity within. For more information, see [Data Products](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/Data_Products_Overview).
7. Click **Create** to finalize and create the entity. The Data Browser opens to the new blank entity.![](https://Profisee.magentrixcloud.com/sys/staticasset/read/file-i23a464be731c50e8.png)
