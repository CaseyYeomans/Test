# Using Fabric for Data Stewardship

Once your data product is associated with complete entities, you can perform basic data stewardship tasks directly within Fabric. The interface operates as a lightweight version of the Profisee Portal, and many of the actions that can be performed are similar in function and scope.

### Data Quality Issues

On the leftmost side of the entity grid is the **Data Quality Indicator,**which signals the status of data quality rules. A green checkmark icon indicates no issues with data quality, where a red exclamation mark icon indicates that a data quality rule has been violated. You can click the icon to view the **Data Quality Status** window to gain more information on what rules have been violated. You can also view data quality issues by opening Edit Record pane, then navigating to the **Issues** tab.

For more information on Data Quality Issues, see [here](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/profiseeplatform/view_data_quality_issues_from_the_portal_entity_grid).

### Edit Records

You can edit the information for any record within an entity by clicking the name of the record, which highlights as a hyperlink. When clicked, the Edit Record pane opens on the righthand side of the instance.

From the **Data** tab, you can edit any of the record's populated fields, then click **Save** or **Save and Close** to confirm the changes.

From the **Issues** tab, you can view any data quality issues that have been flagged for this record.

From the **History** tab, you can view a history of changes made to this record, starting from its initial creation.
